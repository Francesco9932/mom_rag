              "[Document(page_content='\"Please refrain from profane or obscene speech. Direct your comments to council as a whole and refrain from individual or personal attacks. Councilwoman Gilmore, will you please put Council Bill 161 on the floor? Yes, President Brooks, I move that council bill 161 as amended, be placed upon final consideration and do pass. It has been moved and seconded. Councilman. Clerk, go ahead and offer your motion to further amend. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that council bill 161 as amended be further amended in the following particulars on page five, line one, strike 13 .1.9 and replace with 13 .1. ten on page five. Line three strike 13 1.9.3 and replace with 13 one dot and four. Add a new section to the bill which reads as follows Section six A except as otherwise provided in Section six B of this ordinance. With respect to certain site development plan applications, the amendments to the Denver Zoning Code adopted by this ordinance take effect on May five, 2017. B Notwithstanding Section six A of this ordinance, if requested by an applicant, a pending formal site development plan application may be processed under the provisions of the Denver Zoning Code concerning the small LA parking exemption prior to the adoption of this ordinance. The prior small loft parking exemption. If CPD receives a complete application for a mandatory concept review pursuant to section 12 .3.2.2 of the Denver Zoning Code, which was submitted in advance of a required site development plan per section 12 .4.3.3 on or before August 26, 2016, and such application sought to use the prior small loft parking exemption . Great. It has been moved only a second. Great. It\\'s been moved. And second, it comes from members of council. Councilman Clark. Thank you, Mr. President. This amendment updates the zoning code reference that changed as a result to the passage of Council Bill 17 0311. Additionally, it establishes an effective date of May five to mirror the effective date of Council Bill 17.0311. Lastly, it provides clarity that certain applications were not subject to the moratorium on small light parking exemption enacted last August, and those applications may continue to use the small shop parking exemption as existed prior to this proposed text amendment. We had a number of projects that were in the pipeline and the moratorium clearly set forward that they could remain under the rules that under which they had applied. And we just missed that. I think in the bill, I believe the intent was always to allow those to continue progressing, not to progress, and then all of a sudden have the rules changed on them. And this fixes that for the projects that are in the pipeline. And I would ask that all my colleagues please vote to further amend this amended bill. Thank you, Mr. President. Great. And I\\'ll further explain. And I\\'m looking at CPD. I believe there are 11 projects in the current pipeline that have been talked about and agreed with with the community even before we started this process. So. That\\'s why we\\'re doing that. Everybody in the public, we did not want to change the rules, whatever we did on people who had projects in the pipeline. So thank you, Councilman Clarke, for bringing this forward. Councilwoman Sussman woke up, she. I said, that sound like Councilwoman Sussman. And sure enough, it is. You look really good. Okay. All right. Madam Secretary Rocha. Clark. Right. Espinosa. I. Flynn. I Gilmore. I Cashman. I Lopez. I knew. Ortega. I Sussman. Well, I better not vote because I\\'m not sure what we\\'re voting on. You can abstain. Oh, they keep the pipeline. Okay. I just flew in from South Carolina. And, man, my arms are tired. Yes, I had studied this and know this, so I\\'m going to vote II black. All right. Mr. President. I police voting and as results. 11 eyes. 11 eyes. Clarks amendment to keep the folks who had prior projects out of the pipeline for these amendment changes passes. Okay, Madam Secretary, do we need to vote on 161 or do we want to wait till the public here? No. You want to open the public hearing? Great. All right. The public hearing for Council Bill 161, as amended, is open. May we have the staff report? Jeff Hart. Oh. Champagne. Good evening. My name is Karen Champagne. I\\'m the director of Planning Services and Community Planning and Development. I am sharing in this presentation this evening just to provide a broader context for the staff recommendation. So CPD recommends denial of this text amendment to the Denver zoning code. And in a few minutes, senior city planner Jeff Hertz and then zoning administrator Tina Axelrod will provide a lot more technical analysis and details to explain that position. However, just please understand that despite a recommendation of denial of this particular text amendment, no, that we are committed and we do share in the concerns about the issues of parking management in our neighborhoods. We want to make sure that that\\'s important and underscored with this discussion tonight. That is why we are committed and want to state tonight that we\\'re committed to working with our colleagues in public works in the mayor\\'s office and of course, with the community to take a further take to do further analysis of the bigger picture issues in the bigger picture parking management challenges, and explore more holistic common sense solutions which are relevant to a variety of contexts and lot sizes throughout Denver. And to effectively explore the concerns raised during this process, we want to step outside the narrow scope of this particular text amendment, which only addresses lots that comprise 1% of our city. We are committed to near-term solutions and answering tough questions, and that includes how can we promote and expand transportation demand management and integrate TDM programs into private development and strengthen partnerships with existing transportation management associations that are already in place? They\\'re great resources for us. We also want to help answer the questions of how do we better implement Denver\\'s strategic parking plan throughout it, through innovations in pricing and regulations to better balance parking supply and demand. And another hard question that we want to tackle is how do we pay for major improvements to our multimodal network? So fewer people, people are taking trips by car and households can choose to own fewer cars. So in addition to a lot of these really important short term strategies that we\\'re committed to solving, we also have Denver rights, our community driven process that will take a longer a longer term look at advancing these policies. And we are and we, of course, encourage engagement in that process. So we just want to give a little bit of that context. And I\\'d like to introduce Jeff Hertz, senior city planner for a staff report. Thank you. So Jeff Hurt with CPD. So why are you skipping ahead here? So the scope of this tax amendment before you tonight relates to the section of code on the screen, which is a fairly short, discrete section of the Denver zoning code that essentially says that all preexisting zone lots that are less than or equal to 6250 square feet and zoned mixed use commercial do not have to provide any parking. So this is the baseline we\\'re working with today is a full exemption on these lots. This exemption has been in place since 2006 and it originally applied to the Main Street Zone districts, with four primarily concentrated on Colfax. And the primary purpose of that of that bill, among other purposes, was to encourage redevelopment of these small lots without assembly into larger lots. So in this image up here kind of highlights what we\\'re talking about, this smaller pattern of development, typically 50 foot wide by 125 foot deep. And I\\'ll talk a little bit more about that. And then in 2010, the exemption was expanded citywide to all mixed use commercial districts. I think with the recognition that these small lots of the same challenges, regardless if they\\'re in a, you know, on Colfax or anywhere else in the city in these mixed use commercial areas. And then, of course, last year, last August, Council approved a seven month moratorium to study the issue further. And during that time, Councilman Brooks convened a steering committee of about 13 people across different disciplines affordable housing, historic preservation, community activist developers, others. And during that time, I believe they met five times over the course of late 2016, they developed a series of recommendations and input that informed Councilman Brooks\\'s proposal that he brought to the Planning Board in February of this year. And so that proposal was for all of these preexisting small, zoned lots for the first three stories of any new buildings on these lots to be fully exempt from parking, provided that they\\'re in what we\\'re calling transit shared or transit rich areas. And I\\'ll talk a little bit more about what that means here in a minute. And then all other preexisting zoned lots outside of these transit areas, the first two stories are exempt and then further existing buildings would be fully exempt. So this is the prior proposal. Planning Board voted on that proposal on February 1st of this year, 8 to 1 to approve it with the condition that city council not require any additional mandatory parking as the tax amendment advanced. And so following planning board, the Liberty Committee met three times on this issue. And then you all know the moratorium was extended by 60 days. During that time, several amendments were proposed by Councilman Clark. And that gets us to where we are today. So the current proposal that\\'s on the books or in front of you tonight is for, again, preexisting small zoned lots, zoned, mixed use commercial, all new buildings for all new buildings. The first two stories would be exempt in these transit rich areas and for all other new buildings on other preexisting small zoned lots. The first one story is exempted. So it\\'s a reduction in the number of stories by one under these amendments. And then additionally, for all new buildings wishing to use the exemption, they would be required to go through what\\'s called a zoning permit with informational notice. And we\\'ll talk a little bit more about that here in a minute. And under this amended bill, all existing buildings are also fully exempt, but further are allowed to expand up to kind of what the zoning allows a number of stories and get a full exemption. So that\\'s the components of the bill that is before you tonight. And just a real quick overview. I know some of you have seen this before in terms of the scope of where these lots are in the city. They are less than 1% of the city\\'s land area. There\\'s about 3400 parcels that meet this criteria. We unfortunately don\\'t map zone lots, so it\\'s a big approximation, but about 3400 parcels may be eligible for this exemption, and it\\'s actually a fair amount lower than that. When you look at the individual developer ability of these lots and whether or not they could actually use the exemption. 64% of this universe of small lots are in these newly fine transit rich areas that are in the text amendment, and about 90% of them have maximum height entitlements per their underlying zoning of greater than or equal to three stories. And they are concentrated. And we\\'ll look at a map here in a second. They are concentrated along the city\\'s commercial corridors all over the city, really, Colfax, Broadway, South Pearl Morrison, Road and Tennyson, others all around the city. And here\\'s I don\\'t want to belabor this, but if we want to come back to it, this shows the transit rich areas or transit shared areas that are defined by the text amendment before you tonight, which essentially says that if you\\'re in these areas, you get a greater exemption. And that would be if you are within a half a mile of a rail transit station and a quarter mile of a high frequency transit corridor with with, you know, the best bus service in the city. Essentially, the public input we\\'ve received on the bill has mostly been on Councilman Brooks\\'s bill, the prior bill that had an increase in the number of stories and different components to it. So we haven\\'t gotten a lot of public comment at least through CPD on the current amended bill, although I know some comments came in over the weekend on this. So staff\\'s analysis focuses on the three criteria, and the Denver zoning code were tasked to look at and reevaluate text amendments. And I\\'ll go through each one of these briefly. Note that the the evaluation and the recommendations were based on the amendments because the staff did do an analysis and make a recommendation on the prior bill, Councilman Brooks\\'s bill. So we\\'re focusing the analysis on the amendments themselves. There\\'s more detail in your staff report, certainly, but these are the three criteria we look at in terms of consistency with adopted plans. So looking at the First Amendment that\\'s on the table, which is the reduction in the number of stories eligible for the exemption. City staff finds it\\'s inconsistent with citywide plan policies to reduce parking requirements near transit because it would result or is resulting in an increase in mandatory parking on these lots, which staff finds is inconsistent with these policies here and others in the staff report and blueprint differ in the plan. Further on this amendment regarding the number of stories staff finds, it\\'s inconsistent with citywide plan policies to maintain value development patterns. And I\\'ll talk a little bit more about what that means. But we\\'re essentially referring to the smaller development pattern and that kind of increment of development, that rhythm of development that\\'s common on a lot of the city\\'s commercial corridors. And the concern about sort of a threshold or a tipping point where once you start requiring mandatory parking above a certain amount, it may encourage developers to start to look at loft assembly into larger developments that perhaps break that pattern. So this is just a few slides that we have to illustrate the issue. And I don\\'t think these are new slides for everyone that has looked at this. But essentially what we\\'re talking about when we talk about a, you know, the space constraints that these lots have and that tipping point, what we\\'re looking at here, I want to pull up my little laser pointer. So what we\\'re looking at here is a is an illustration of a common small pattern. You see in Denver, I\\'m looking at three preexisting small zone lots, 50 foot wide by 125 foot deep. And the the image on the top or on the right shows that for most of these lots, which are primarily alley access, you could only physically fit five parking spaces. Once you get above that five parking space threshold, then you start to get into the space constraints where you\\'re essentially mandating unless there\\'s some other really creative way that no one has been able to figure out that we haven\\'t seen yet. You\\'re essentially mandating a different form of parking with tuck under parking or structured parking, because now you have to accommodate the space of the additional parking spaces and the adjacent drive aisles going into them. So there\\'s a number of issues with that. One is that, you know, you\\'re obviously eating into the buildable square footage of these on these lots on the first floor significantly. And then to just looking at the cost per space, that\\'s typical of a parking space. Surface parking, like the ones in the example to the right are going to be far less expensive than structured parking that you would see at the tuck under parking scenario. So just to highlight the scenario and how it plays out with the different sort of components of the bill and the amendments to the bill and that related to the number of stories. So looking at the the prior bill, which had an exemption for the first three stories for any new building, and these are assuming that this scenario would be in that transit shed. And looking at the C.M. Zone District in this scenario, which is a very common, I believe, the most common zoning that these this universe of parcels has the prior proposal would have would have allowed zero parking would have gotten full exemption because it was three stories in the transit shed. And when you look at the the amended bill, it goes up to eight spaces. In this scenario, there\\'s a number of scenarios of different development types. This scenario has a three story mixed use building where you have ground floor, commercial and upper floor residential. And so there\\'s all kinds of ways to slice and dice the course. But looking at a common scenario, this is sort of what the the change in the number of stories might do to a project and kind of kick it into that that threshold of requiring more parking and creating challenges. So for the for the Second Amendment regarding the zoo, Panama, I\\'ll let Tina Axelrod, our zoning administrator, speak to that briefly. Thanks, Jeff. Tina Axelrod with KPD Development Services and the zoning administrator for the city of Denver. So I have overview of all of our permitting staff who would have to implement this tax amendment. And we appreciate the opportunity to talk about this one particular element of the bill that will affect the everyday life of the permitting staff , and that is the introduction of a zoning permit with informational notice process attached to a determination of whether new buildings on existing small lots will get the exemption or not. Generally, staff has looked at this quite deeply and seriously, and we find that it\\'s inconsistent with a couple of key citywide goals. One is creating a predictable zoning process, and the other is where a process is put in place with public participation that that parties and participation be meaningful. And we\\'re finding that in this case, we can\\'t find that that exist. We believe that the Zipkin process, the way it\\'s structured and the amendment does not give any guidance or criteria to staff to use during the process, as the plan involves a staff review after several steps of notification to the public and an invitation for public comment to take all that information and decide whether one the request is meeting the requirements of the code. So in this case, is it a new building and is it on a small lot that should be easy enough? And then the additional criteria of whether the proposal will have adverse impacts on surrounding properties that cannot be mitigated. And it\\'s that part that\\'s going to be unpredictable for applicants. There\\'s no guidance for staff as to what those impacts are that we should be looking for. Generally, the types of impacts we hear about is on the public right of way and the impact of on street parking, which zoning does not have jurisdiction over. So we couldn\\'t condition an approval to provide more on Trey Parker or to mitigate that impact. Similarly, on the public engagement, the invitation of public comment, what we\\'ve seen mostly again address a lot of issues that zoning doesn\\'t have jurisdiction over. If there\\'s an impact. On the demand for on street parking, we can\\'t really address that. That\\'s kind of embedded in the amendment itself that there probably will be some impact if you don\\'t provide it on site, maybe people will need it off our site. And that creates perhaps a false expectation to the public that their comments and complaints will affect an outcome that might already be pretty straightforward otherwise. So together with that, I\\'ll turn it back to Jeff, and I\\'m happy to answer any questions about that. So here\\'s just a couple of the the citywide planning policies pointing to the discipline issue as well. So the second criteria, so there\\'s first the consistency with adopted plans. The second is regarding public health, safety and welfare. On this criteria, State finds the proposed amendment does not further the public welfare. On balance, with looking at all these issues, because, one, it increases the challenges to redevelop small zone lots, especially those in transit rich areas. Two, that the small pattern is a valued community attribute and the proposal may lead to increased assembly of small lots. And third, by making the redevelopment more challenging on these lots, it will likely detract from the city\\'s goals to build more affordable housing. And the last criteria uniformity of district regulations and restrictions, fines. This is consistent because it will result in new regulations applied consistently across preexisting small zone lots zone mixed use commercial. So CPD does recommend denial of the bill, finding that two of the three text amendment criteria are not met. In addition to the inconsistency with the with the Planning Board\\'s recommendation and the steering committee process as well, but mainly the text amendment criteria. I\\'m glad to answer any questions. All right. Thank you. We have 22 speakers this evening and I\\'m going to ask that we reserve this front bench. Even staff of the staff can sit right over there and we can get all the folks on this firm. But first five to call you up right now. Margie Valdez, John. Ricky George, male. And Joe Berrios. Let\\'s see. One, two, three, four. And Sharon Nunnally. Five. First up is going to be Margie Valdez. You have 3 minutes. Thank you. Good evening, Council. I am pleased to speak before you tonight in support of the adoption of Bill 17 161. I speak on behalf of Inter Neighborhood Cooperation and the Zoning and Planning Committee, which I am the Chair of December 3rd, 2016 32 to 0 at the zoning and planning meeting. Proposed language for small parking exemption. Language presented by CPG was confusing and members could not approve the proposed zoning amendment. That vote was 32 to nothing. On January 14th, 2017, the vote at the delegate meeting, the delegates voted 42 nine to extend the moratorium. March 2nd, 2017. Zoning and Planning Committee Members voted to support. Councilman Clark\\'s amendment. The vote was 27 nine. April 3rd, 2017. Delegates were advised to that I would be sending thank you letters to both President Brooks and Councilman Clark for their leadership with regard to the small to the small lot exemption and appreciate all the effort that they have put into this. I and C is most appreciative of the Zoning Zep pen process. We understand we don\\'t. Neighborhoods are not going to be able to have a veto process, but it gives us an opportunity to engage in conversation with the developers and to hopefully mitigate some of the impact to the neighborhoods. But we do understand we do not have veto power in our opinion. The proposed ordinance balances the concerns of the neighborhood and the developers. It takes into consideration the impacts to the neighborhood, and it is a win win solution. It supports the ordinance adopted by this Council last week. Concerning environmental issues which impact this precious planning. We urge Council support for a bill 17 161 the the intent of i n c that has always been to support the proposed ordinance of Councilman Clark. And we have never wavered in our support of that proposed ordinance. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Valdez. John Rickey. Hello. My name is John Ricky. I live at 945 Washington Street in Mr. News District. I\\'ll start by stating stating a simple fact. If council votes to increase parking minimums, it is voting to increase housing costs, whether affordable or market rate or luxury. There will be fewer new units on small lots and they will be more expensive. Every dollar spent housing cars is a dollar not spent on housing people. Every dollar spent on unneeded parking is a dollar not circulating among local business. Every dollar spent to store a car is a dollar not spent buying shoes or eating out or paying for medication or being saved for retirement. Adding parking requirements, by definition, adds to the cost of living in Denver and reduces our quality of life. Council has repeatedly stated its preference for less driving and more walkability in our neighborhoods. But here council is focusing solely on the desires of homeowners to protect their use of the commons for their car storage. All other citizens. Those too young to drive. Those too old. Even the working poor. All their needs for affordable housing, safe streets and walkable destinations within their neighborhoods are being put aside to protect the parking privileges of a few lucky property owners. Why is council considering a vote today to protect a preference for free street parking over the need for affordable housing? Why is space for parking cars more desirable than space for small neighborhood businesses? This isn\\'t just unfair, it\\'s bad economics. Even The Economist magazine, which is no bastion of lefty urban utopianism, recently ran an article decrying the damage done to cities by parking minimums, respected academics, authors and city planners from Donald Shoup to Jarrett Walker to Charles Miron have all pointed out the increased cost and decreased livability that comes with parking minimums. I call on you not to let the potential scarcity of parking determine Denver\\'s future. We deserve better than that. I urge you to remember the pictures of downtown when parking was considered more important than people or places. Denver deserves better than that. If we prize parking above affordable housing, more than walkability, greater than the needs of small business, and consider it more important than the livability needs of our youngest, oldest and poorest citizens, then we are not looking to the future and we are not building an equitable or sustainable city. Don\\'t vote for increased housing costs. Don\\'t vote to subsidize car ownership. Don\\'t vote to continue the failed transportation policies of your predecessors. Don\\'t vote for this amendment. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ricky. George. Male. Good evening, city council members, and thank you for allowing us to have this opportunity to address this issue. My name is George Male. I reside at 1075 South Garfield Street in beautiful Corey Merrill, District six. I\\'m going to cut to the quick. All of you were apprized of the results of the i.n.s. citywide survey. Encompassing all the major concerns of your constituents. All of you were met privately on the results of that citywide survey. And if you\\'ll recall in that survey, the number one issue was extreme, unbridled development. And if you recall, all of you solved this on your meeting with the ANC representatives on this survey, 70% of constituents noted unbridled. Concerns on that. Also the number four pick. Was parking. You all remember this, don\\'t you? From. From the meeting we all had. So bear that in mind. What you decide here will have ramifications that will affect the city for generations. And all indications are that the automobile will still play a part in that. Unlike past city councils, we, the voting citizens of Denver, hold you responsible now for the protection of residential neighborhoods and smart development. You are accountable to us, not CBD, not excise and licensing. You\\'re accountable to us. And we will remember every vote that is cast that does not take into consideration the protection of our neighborhoods. You. Your respective council districts have spoken in regards to their concerns. It is up to you to leave them of those concerns here today. Now, I have spoken to you before about perception of developers having sway in this city. But we have the votes and we will get the votes. It\\'s time for you to tell your constituents, we hear you, we agree with you, and we are going to do what\\'s right for you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Joe Berrios. Hi. Oh, good evening, City Council. So I was here seven months ago now, I guess when we introduced the moratorium and I talked about this various quantities. No, just. Just say your name. Oh, okay. Residents for. Joe. Berrios and I now live at 1131 28th Street. Okay. Do I get a restart now? All right. Okay. I\\'ll give you a couple more. Seconds. There. So I was here a couple months ago and I talked about how important this decision was to my family. So I just want to catch you up. What\\'s happened with my family since then? So we were living at 1950 Logan Street in a one bedroom apartment that cost us 1300 dollars we were renting. We needed a bigger place because we were having a baby. And so we started looking. We couldn\\'t afford anything in that neighborhood. And so we moved to another neighborhood. And then that same apartment rented for 1700 dollars, and it went in one day. So it just. Just think about that. For one, it went up $400 and was gone in one day. And so when we talk about this parking exemption, there\\'s no decision that you make that\\'s in a vacuum. So if you think that this doesn\\'t affect affordable housing, please think again. I received a response when I emailed a few of you that this is considered a false narrative because developers aren\\'t required to provide affordable housing as related to these exemptions. But that negates a basic supply and demand principle, right? If they\\'re required to provide parking, the cost of their projects goes up. They pass those costs along to the customer, which in this case is the renters, and then we end up paying for that cost. So our costs as families, as workers go up. Now, I\\'ve heard a lot of you talk about sustainability. And transit and pedestrians and. Workers and families. This is a decision that affects all of those. You cannot make this decision in a vacuum. So while some folks here are defending their right to park their car, I\\'m here defending my right for my family to be able to afford where we live. Those two shouldn\\'t be the same. So I ask you to please consider what you\\'re doing to the housing costs when you make this decision. Don\\'t forget about us. We may not be as important as somebody\\'s car. That. I hope that\\'s not the case. Thank you. Thanks, Ms.. Barrios. Sharon Nunnally. Good evening, council members. My name is Sharon Nunnally. I live at 1643 North Humboldt Street. I have been involved with many boards and commissions in this city and I was on the planning board when the current code was adopted. The zoning code is a fluid document that sometimes requires. Adjustment for real issues in real time when the code was being rewritten. Throughout the process. The public and property owners were reassured that they would have an opportunity to address things that might become problems in the future. Things that were not working, things that might never work. So I think that that was a very particularly important process, part of the process, and it made people feel more comfortable about the code since it was really different from Chapter 59. One of the things, though, that I am really happy about is that the process of yes, we are going to look at things is indeed working. The planning staff has a very hard job. I understand it and I know that is hard to get to some form of compromise on complex issues like this one. This is not just about people wanting to quote unquote, keep parking. That is not the issue here. The issue here is how do we move forward in this city and bring good development? We can do it with limited parking, but we do still have some challenges. Our transit system is not there yet and we\\'ve got a long ways to go with that. And unfortunately, the city does not control our transit system as it exists right now. So we have come to you with an amendment that I think has been vetted with the appropriate agencies, with council. Is it perfect? Not by a long shot. However, we have to start somewhere and do something. The beauty is that if this doesn\\'t work, we can still work on it. And that is critical. It will not cause developers to build more or less housing that\\'s going to be affordable, but I certainly believe that it will cause them to be more creative in getting us to some more and better housing. I urge you to support Councilman Clarke\\'s amendment. Thank you very much. Thank you, Miss Lenawee. All right, Ben Gerhart, I\\'m sorry. Going to call the next five up. Mr. Rickey, you can head back. Ben Gerhart, Craig Damon, Charlie Bosch, David Engel in two, three, four and Gertie Grant. Mr. Gerhart, you\\'re up first. Good evening, Ben Gerhart. I live in District one at 3931 Julian Street. And just wanted to thank counsel, really. I\\'ll be short and sweet for making that amendment on projects that were. Submitted prior to the moratorium. Appreciate it. We move forward with good faith and knowing that you guys supported that. So that\\'s it. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Mr. Craig. Good evening. I\\'m Craig Deming and I reside 1744 Vine Street. I\\'m here to speak on behalf of the Uptown Urban Design Forum. As most of you know. The forum includes representatives from Kaiser Permanente, National Jewish and St Joe\\'s Hospitals, Presbyterian Saints, Luke\\'s Hospital, Children\\'s Hospital in Denver, and various registered neighborhood associations adjoining them, including San Rafael and Whittier Neighborhood Association, at the forum meeting last week. The representatives present voted unanimously, unanimously to have me represent them at this public hearing and to request your vote in favor of the small text amendments you have before you. In doing that, we would like to express, on behalf of the Forum our gratitude for your long and careful deliberations and the shape you\\'ve given to this text amendment language. Excuse me. Over the past 12 months, the forum has several times voted and sent letters of support. First, for the small lot moratorium, which you passed unanimously in last August, and then for development in various committees and in council of the Text Amendment language you have before you. We feel it goes a long way in providing a fair balance between the hospital\\'s own neighborhood and developer interests. When Reform first began consideration of its importance. One thing that stood out for our representatives of our medical care institution was the growing importance of the many new and diverse 17th Avenue restaurants and businesses which are at the point of an important amenity for our patients, family and staff. The residents, particularly on Humboldt, Franklin and Gilpin Streets, provide essential overflow parking support for those restaurants and businesses which do not have parking lots themselves. We welcome your votes in favor of this balanced language text amendment, which will help to maintain the success of that mutual support between our health institutions, with their patients families, the excellent diversity of our 17 avenue businesses and our neighborhood residents. Thank you. Thank you, Mr.. Charlie Bush. Hello. And thank you. My name is Charlie Bush. I live at 715 South Sherman Street, which is one quarter mile less than a quarter mile from the I-25 and Broadway station, about a half mile to the Alameda station and one block from the zero and zero L line. I live right smack in the middle of all these big transportation quarters you\\'re talking about, with the exception of Paul Lopez. This is a pretty new council and I\\'ve been gone for a couple of years. So let me give you my credentials. I have been working on transit oriented development and parking and traffic issues since 2005. I have worked on the first three of four transit oriented developments in the state in in the city in county of denver. I know more about traffic and parking than any i.t. Geek ever really wanted to know. And i say this just because of that. You know, i\\'m not just somebody trying to protect the parking in front of my house. I mean, looking at this large the larger picture for a long time, i\\'m in support of this bill with its amendment, even though it will further crush my area of my neighborhood. I don\\'t think this bill and the amendment go far enough. I see it as a first step. You know, I\\'ve been hearing the ongoing thinking push by developers that just if you just don\\'t build parking, then people will get there and they won\\'t use their cars. I keep hearing about the strategic parking plan and that millennials won\\'t own cars because they\\'re a different generation. Supposedly by now, we should have been all driving bicycles, scooters and skateboards. This makes me very weary. Let me tell you about my corner of near I-25 and Broadway. I live on one of those little blocks that has a bungalow every 3700 or. We only have 37 feet on the front. I have 18 different little townhomes along exposition between Lincoln and Logan. In addition, we back to Lincoln and there are a bunch of formerly illegal bungalows that were illegally put into smaller and smaller and smaller units. And guess what? They mirror exactly what you\\'re talking about. Lots of little units with no parking. And you know what? They\\'re all millennials and they all have cars and they all try to park on our street. We already have heavy parking issues with this. Then RTD took out the Alameda parking and said, Oh, don\\'t build the parking. They\\'ll find other ways to get there. Yeah, you know how they get there? They park on our streets and then they go to I-25 and Broadway. The last zoning code provided mixed use combined and consolidated parking, which was supposed to be up and down Broadway. It has never happened. Responding to the request, all of the neighborhoods. We did do a parking plan from Alameda North to try to alleviate some of the parking of all of those businesses into the neighborhoods. It has provided a little relief, but according to people there, not much. We haven\\'t had anything from Alameda South. What we are experiencing is an increasing incidence of violence in the parking area. So far it has only been property damage. You might not hear about it because right now it\\'s just taking the form of nails in tires and keys on cars. I\\'ve had both. Now, for me, it doesn\\'t matter that much because my car has sat outside for 20 years and doesn\\'t have a whole lot of paint on it. You know, so that big scratch that I now have down the side of my car. You know, they had to work pretty hard to put it there. The last time that I had to fix a tire because I had to park a street over and I had to leave it there for three days was just three weeks ago. And I\\'m hearing the same thing up and down. Sherman and Sherman and Grant all the way to Alameda, especially around Alameda. Don\\'t swallow the pill that says if you don\\'t build that, everybody will take transit. I\\'m not seeing it. And I\\'ve been doing this for 12 years. It\\'s getting worse. It\\'s getting vicious. And it\\'s getting dangerous. Again. I do support this bill and the amendment, but please take it as a first step. Please do not swallow the pill. If you don\\'t build it, everybody will take transit. It might happen 20 years in the future, but it\\'s not happening soon. Thank you for your time. Thank you, Mrs. Bush. Uh, David Engel can. All right. I\\'m sorry. Let me see here. Gurney Grant. Good evening, council members and thank you very much for the opportunity to address you tonight on this issue. My name is Gertrude O\\'Grady. Grant and I live at 242 South Lincoln Street in Denver. I\\'ve lived there since 1997. I\\'m on the board of the West Washington Park Neighborhood Association, the boundaries of which are I-25 to Speer and downing to Broadway. And I\\'m here tonight to tell you that by a vote of 12 to 0 two zero between Wednesday, April 26th and Saturday, April 29th, the board voted by email, pursuant to our bylaws, to approve a motion to support the compromise ordinance, amending the zoning code to provide. The off street parking. Exemptions for preexisting small lots. We\\'ve been discussing this for over a year and a half on our board and on our zoning committee. And we recognize that this is a compromise. It\\'s not what everybody wants, but it\\'s a whole heck of a lot better than it was before it before this amendment. Personally, while I completely support the admirable goal of reducing auto use and encouraging everybody to use alternative ways to get where they want to go, one major alternative for people in my age bracket is public transportation. And to call it enhanced transit doesn\\'t make any sense to me when I\\'m standing there in July with ice. Cream dripping out of my bag waiting for the zero bus to go home from the supermarket. Denver doesn\\'t have what I would call an enhanced transit zone. Secondly, many of my children\\'s friends who have moved to Denver for job opportunities came not only for jobs, but because there\\'s recreation in the mountains. And guess what? You can\\'t get there on a bike, at least not. Within a day. And you can\\'t. The only way you can get there is a car. So they save their money and they buy a car. They want cars to get to the mountains. We don\\'t have a transit system. Not only within the city of Denver, but enough to get people up to one of the main reasons that people have moved here, which is recreation. So I urge you, please, to support the ordinance amending the Denver zoning code to revise the parking exemption for preexisting small lots. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ms.. Grant McCall. The next five up. Bob Heckman. John. Joseph Nieman. Tricia. Hutch. Joseph. Chip. Capella and James Davis. Bob Hickman. You have 6 minutes. Good evening. Council President Bush, Brooks and council members. I\\'m Bob Hickman. I live at 291 South Kilbourne Street in Denver. Tonight you have before you a bill born of the moratorium molded by the small committee, chiseled by the original bill brought by Councilman Brooks. And polished by the subsequent amendments brought by Councilman Clerk. It seems to me there are two choices this evening pass this bill, or practically speaking, the moratorium will end and small lots are back to a full parking exemption. This bill is balanced. It most likely doesn\\'t satisfy any interests entirely, but it does represent the best approach for an interim solution while a citywide transportation and parking management plan can be developed and implemented. This balanced bill weighs several major interests. It does require less parking than for small lots than would be required for a typical larger lot a step towards fewer cars and less car ownership. The bill provides significant developer relief from parking constraints inherent in small lots. It encourages a developer to actively engage in the parking solution for their project, such as providing minimal parking and taking advantage of existing reductions, like a 25% reduction for being in a transit area. 20% for building affordable housing, a five for one trade off for car share, five spaces, one car share. These are significant things that a developer can pursue to reduce his parking requirement and help that project get built. It provides neighborhood relief from parking being forced to the streets where they live. It also provides notice to potentially impacted neighborhoods for a given project. And very importantly, it sets up a scenario that will provide incentives for all interests to engage in finding a better transportation and parking management plan as we move forward. We will all have a stake in making sure this process is undertaken efficiently and expeditiously. On the other hand, if this bill does not pass, the moratorium will expire. And we are back to the language allowing a full parking exemption. All the issues from projects that spawned the moratorium are still in place and could be repeated hundreds of times throughout Denver, including those of, quote, unintended consequences, unquote. No neighborhood notice is required. No process is established to arrive at a solution with greater emphasis for all projects, not just those on small lots. There are exciting and far reaching mobility issues, solutions in our future, whatever they may turn out to be. It will be several years. Further effective implementation prototypes will be developed and tested. Refinements will be made with retesting. Impacts will be measured. But we will get there. Probably not in my lifetime. But we will get there. As I\\'ve stated to you before, I believe in balance. And even more firmly, I believe in evolution, not revolution. Let\\'s prepare a thoughtful plan and move forward to its goal in a measured way, step by step. I urge you to pass this bill this evening, and thank you for allowing me to speak. Thank you, Mr. Hickman. John Joseph Neiman. Yeah. My name is John Joseph and I live at 2786 South Wolfe Street. Denver, Colorado is my home. I\\'m a native. I\\'ve seen the way our city is changed. And what I want to talk about today is a bit about the process that you guys have gone through in order to come to this bill and show some appreciation for the work that you\\'ve put into taking what was kind of came about suddenly and turned it into an opportunity to talk about one of these big issues in our city. As George May alluded to, parking and density are some of the major concerns of our neighborhoods, and those concerns have been talked about at length in the formation of this amended bill. And I think that process was worthwhile. And bringing this bill to city council tonight was worthwhile. So what I\\'m asking as a citizen and also as the president of the Denver Neighborhood Cooperation is that you guys respect the amount of time and effort that community has put in to discussing this and that you guys have put into discussing and coming up with a better solution short term and allowing for an opportunity for us to become better at managing parking long term. So I really commend us for taking this small exemption in a small way and turning it into a bigger discussion and one that I think has benefited the city and benefited neighborhoods as far as I can tell. So thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Newman. Tricia Hook. Sorry if I mispronounced that. Good evening, Councilman. President Brooks Thank you for the opportunity to speak. My name is Tricia Huth. I live at. 1633 Humboldt Street. I would like to speak to the conversation that\\'s been going on that was addressed in the Denver Street Blog\\'s article, and it\\'s it was entitled Simple Data Shatters. There Is No Parking Myth. The article says that there\\'s an average of 187 spaces available in a three block radius of 16th and Humboldt. The numbers are from a parking inventory by public works and are a snapshot of three times of the day 5 a.m., noon and 7 p.m.. The respective totals of available parking are 256, 168 and 138. Really. I live right in the heart of this and I have never. Seen anything like that. A couple of problems with with this citation. First of all, there\\'s no description. Of what the actual. Area was. Is the radius based on north south blocks, which are. Considerably longer. Or east west blocks which are. Shorter? There\\'s no description of the actual total spaces. There\\'s no way to calculate the percentage of spaces occupied. And is the three block radius a reasonable distance from a parked car to a residence? I can tell you from where I live, I\\'m locked in by a three lanes of one way traffic on 17th Avenue and four lanes of two way traffic on Colfax. So if I go three blocks in either direction, I would have to. Cross one of those main, main areas. And we did our own survey over the course of dates from from April 9th to April 29th. And we sampled for four blocks, a stretch of two blocks each, making a total. Of ten blocks. There were 11. Samples taken in the early morning, late morning, early afternoon and evening and 10 p.m.. And the average availability in those eight square blocks was nine spaces. How much time do I have left? I raised my children in this neighborhood. It\\'s always been an issue. When I would pull. Up with groceries and children in car seats, it was it was always this weighing, do I take the children in first? Do I take the groceries in first? It\\'s only going to get worse. It\\'s going to be very. Very difficult for. Families to live in these conditions with this parking deprivation. So I am asking you to vote in favor of this bill. Thank you. Thank you. Most of all right. Joseph Coppola. Coppola. Thank you. My name is Chip Coppola. I live at 1410 South Pennsylvania Street. I was on the steering committee, as you know. Councilman Brooks and Councilman Cashman for the old South Pearl Street area of Platt Park. I\\'m here to support the bill as amended. If the bill hadn\\'t been amended, I would not have been able to stand up here and say I support it because the changes in particular the Z pin and lowering the height were so critical to what we believe in. Our neighborhood is necessary. We have on the 14 and 1500 blocks, we have 11 restaurants. We have a 16 unit micro building going up. And I know that the merchants there are wondering, what are we going to do? Where are we going to go? We just went through with Cindy Patton and staff a two year process of trying to figure out the parking in our neighborhoods. And it\\'s because of amendment that we can support this and would look forward to it. And we hope that you would adopt it. One thing I would just like to point out, having to do with Mr. Hurt\\'s presentation about what you can do on this size lot here and there. We have one double lot that is under development right now on Pearl Street. That is 16 units and they\\'re providing either seven or eight parking spaces. I\\'m a real estate attorney. I have a client that\\'s going through the process and she\\'s putting eight units with eight parking spaces on a double lot. Economically, it\\'s still works. You just don\\'t need to be greedy. So thank you very much for your support and all your hard work. Thank you. Thank you. Ms.. James Davis. Good evening. How you guys doing? It\\'s good to see you. I want to thank you for your time. This has been a really engaging process. I\\'ve been watching at home. As I did it, I knew it. Thank you for stopping me. James Davis. 2380 Ivanhoe. Street. I told myself it wasn\\'t. Going to do it either. I told myself and there I go. 2380 Ivanhoe Street. I\\'m a millennial. I sold my car when I moved here. Hey, Kendra, it\\'s nice to see you. I sold my car when I moved here. So we\\'re going to talk about actual experiences. You know, anyone cases? I am. I am that person that those developers point to who rides his bike every day and makes 60% of his trips via bicycle. So we do exist and we may seem like unicorns, but we are out here. We\\'re right here. But on a more serious note, you know, as somebody who was raised by a single mother, somebody who was raised in a low income household, I always ask myself the question. How does this impact working people? How does this work impact people that are of the working poor who are trying to make it in Denver? You know, and identify one key area where this is important to them. And that\\'s in the affordable housing domain. You know, we\\'ve talked a lot. We talked a lot. A lot of people have brought this up. But I really wanted to talk about that in the public record, because I think it\\'s really important to note that when you require more parking, it does make developed more expensive. It makes it harder to develop affordable housing. The recent Obama administration report that I sent to all of you today via email, the housing development tool kit look in your emails, it\\'s all in there. One of their key strategies is to reduce on excuse me, reduce off street parking requirements because it has the cost of that parking makes it very, very difficult. It just increases, you know, costs of housing in general. You know, it\\'s a it\\'s a simple thing. The even the Urban Land Institute also chimed in on this. That\\'s another report I sent along to you all. They also said that one of the key strategies to increasing the affordable housing supply is reducing off street parking requirements to reputable organizations. Please peruse those reports at your leisure and feel free to contact me if you have any questions about them. The empirical evidence backs this point. It\\'s a very simple point that when you reduce parking requirements, it makes things more affordable. They\\'ve done this in Seattle. There\\'s great anecdotal discussion in that report. The White House Housing Development Toolkit that talks about Seattle\\'s experience of this, they actually talk about Denver and point out Denver and their recent work to reduce parking requirements in their zoning code as a best case. I want to echo something that Councilman Brooks said in this process. He said no other city is doing this across the country. No other cities are adding parking requirements. Let\\'s keep moving in that direction. Let\\'s keep moving in a direction where everybody can live in Denver and people aren\\'t priced out and forced to drive 45 minutes to an hour just to get in because they don\\'t make enough money. Let\\'s live in a Denver where everybody can get around and has options to bike, use, bus or walk or use car. Okay, you got it. Just in time. Thank you, Mr. Davis. All right, I\\'m going to call up the next five. Paul Davison, Sue Glassmaker, Eileen Feldman, Barbara Stockland Staley and Doug Geddes. All up, all to the front, please. Paul Davidson. You are first. Thank you. My name is Paul Davidson. I live at 3230 Arapahoe Street. I am in Curtis Park. I serve on the Curtis Park Board, although I\\'m speaking as a citizen here. And I was a member of the steering committee with Councilman Brooks and Cashman, where I opposed the original decisions in the bill. But first. I just want to thank you for your deep consideration and openness. Emails are read and responded. To and it\\'s a testament to. Your passion. I was stunned when I heard about this parking exemption. I thought because it was about 300 feet from my house, which was an 1891 rowhouse that. Did not have alley access where I lived for 15 years. And I thought, how is this possible and why would they have this exemption in the neighborhood? I wondered why Xp-Pen Xp-Pen would not be required or it would be required for greater than 50% reductions in parking requirements, but not required for a 100% parking exemption. Why wouldn\\'t they tell. Us about this? I wondered why would the developer claim that the people that would stay there would be car free when that\\'s demonstrably false? Even in Capitol Hill, where there\\'s nearly one car per household, I wondered why would large developments be allowed to take this parking exemption when it was clearly intended for small developments and then side by side, 50 units, side by side? I wondered why was it implemented on East Colfax, but never used anywhere else or never used on East Colfax? And then in 2010 expanded to citywide. For these laws that are so varied and so abnormal that even in Curtis Park, the two that are right next to each other, a completely different types of lots. Where. One really requires this exemption and the other one can take a few parking spots so long as the developer did it. And they did it by working with the city, with the neighborhood. I wondered why make claims about affordability when they\\'re actually being sold at market rates and when micro units actually. Go for more per square. Foot than typical units? That\\'s not true. Affordable housing. I now understand the nuances and I believe that what we\\'re looking at tonight is a good, balanced and interim solution. And I hope that the team process will will look closely at the issues that I feel don\\'t totally get addressed, which are retaining the existing buildings and keeping our neighborhoods character on South Coast and South Pearl and Tennyson and encouraging commercial use on the first floor to ensure that our Cemex areas are truly Cemex areas. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Davidson. Sue Glassmaker. I\\'m Sue Glass Maker, and I also live in Curtis Park. I think this bill is mediocre at best. It\\'s not. It\\'s what we have to work with and what was given to us. And but it has something going for it. It does the job. It slows things down enough so that we don\\'t. Create a problem and we can work on everything CPD talked about. I think there are a lot more things that we could do on this small lots and it\\'s it just needs more study and you can change this bill. You can overwrite it just like you did with affordable the portable housing bill. We changed that drastically. So you can change this again when we have something better. But for now, it\\'s a conservative approach in that. You\\'re not letting you\\'re not just saying. Go, go, go do it and do it all. And then saying, Oh, we created a problem. So let\\'s take this a little bit slower. In times. Of this unprecedented. Development and growth that we have. Let\\'s be a little thoughtful. Now, the other thing is it\\'s only 1% of the lots. My councilman pointed that out to me. And if it\\'s only 1% of the lot, how is how is 1% of the lots going to fix the affordable housing problem in Denver? I don\\'t think it\\'s going to be that 1% that really makes the difference. And I don\\'t think it\\'s going to hurt the development community that 1% of the lights cannot be maximized to the absolute highest level. So I don\\'t think there is a problem passing this bill, and I would encourage us all to continue and do better . And I do think there is better out there. But I also don\\'t think it\\'s going to hurt us to pass this and it will help us. And I thank you very much. Thank you. Ms.. Glassmaker, Eileen Feldman. Yes. Hi, my name is Eileen Feltman. I also live in Curtis Park and I am up here to say support the zone lot parking exemption amendment as it was presented by Councilman Clark in Detroit. Quite truthfully, I don\\'t think it I think it\\'s a decent compromise. I don\\'t think it addresses all the things that are important. But it\\'s a great start. And I urge you all to do the same and support this. You know, I know we all want greater opportunities with with regard to affordable housing, attainable housing, neighborhoods, sensitive and responsible development, and of course, a significant reduction in the use of car ownership and usage. However, the elimination of parking requirements at this time will not do this. Not right now. Denver is not there yet. We have a lot of things to work on. With the exception of the East Colfax corridor, we do not have in Denver other high frequency transit opportunities for citizens. Even on Welton Street. It\\'s a little short rail line that goes to nowhere, that runs infrequently for people to be able to get to work, to school, whatever. It\\'s not there yet in Denver has the opportunity to let this be a place to start. Um, one of the things that I\\'ve noticed is in fact with each regional train addition, teams like local bus service is eliminated. That actually puts low income people at reduces opportunity for getting to work, getting to school, whatever the responsibility is, and actually makes people more car dependent. So I think what we need to do is pass this and as Sue and other people pointed out, this can continue to be a work in progress along the lines. I think that Denver really needs to take the opportunity now to really start looking at a really comprehensive city bus service as RTD continues to become more regional in less and less serves the inner city population and is where we really need to make some of these parking exemptions really contingent on true affordable housing opportunities. Quite frankly, developers are just using too many developers are using the opportunity to max out their build. When you have 350 square foot market micro units going for close to $1,000, that\\'s not affordability. That\\'s exploitation. So let\\'s slow this all down. This would be a really good place to start. And we have opportunity to have more conversations and to refine this further. Thank you. Thank you. Ms.. FELBER. Barbara Stockman. Celia, I think I\\'ve seen you before. Hi, I\\'m Barbara Stockman. Celia, I live at 1003 Emmerson Street in Capitol Hill. Good evening. Members of the City Council. I am here representing Goddess. And he was when I left the city about a year ago. I was he was one of my first clients and I was hired to help him through the landmark and the neighborhood processes. He is the developer of D Line, which is 3148 Stout and 3021 Downing in the Curtis Park historic district that uses the smallest parking exemption. And just I just want to give you a brief snapshot of what this process is look like for for him. He purchased the property and fall of 2015. These were lots that were not being snapped up. They were they had a lot of issues. They had were in poor condition with semi abandoned buildings. He worked on them and filed for concept review in June of 2016. There were a lot of neighborhood and landmark commission issues because it is in the Curtis Park historic district. So he worked with the neighborhood, went many rounds with the neighborhood, and LPC resubmitted his concept on August 24th, 2016, got the landmark commission first round of approval in September of 2017. Continue to work through building fire code issues as well as additional landmark and neighborhood issues. Eventually got the landmark second approval on February 21st just this year, filed for site development plan in early March, got comments back in April and is slated to log in for permits this week, May 3rd. All of this. This has been nearly a year since the first concept review, but we greatly appreciate the public and design review process. I think it\\'s made the project better and it\\'s going to be compatible and a great addition to the Curtis Park neighbors. Having said all that, we greatly appreciate Councilmember Clarke\\'s amendment added to the. Today to allow applicants such as the goddess who are midstream in the development process to operate under the existing zoning code. If this bill passes tonight, this amendment would allow developers who have been operating in good faith under the process to move for and not have to circle back and be subject to a new set of zoning rules and processes. Additional Process. While we have no comment or opinion on the bill, we greatly appreciate your support for the May 1st Amendment. If the bill is passed tonight, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Steel, and come visit us again. All right. Doug Harris is not here. The last two, Keith Pryor, John Hagan. Come on up to the front. Good evening. Keith Pryor, 2418 champion Curtis Park. One staff does not support this. That\\'s a huge red flag to me. Huge red flag. You\\'ve done a lot of work. There\\'s a lot more work that needs to be done. Most of the speakers said that this is a great first start, but it needs to be amended. There needs to be more things done to this to actually make it work for our city. People have talked about affordable housing. Well, it may not necessarily be related to the parking issue. You only have so many mixed use districts in this city currently, and as a result, everyone wants to live in them. Guess what? Your price goes up in those desirable, walkable, mixed use neighborhoods. We need to create a lot more of those, which by having this go and past today, you\\'re denying those opportunities to create other desirable areas in the city to help combat our affordable housing crisis because only people want to live in mixed use areas that are walkable. It doesn\\'t matter if you have a car or not. This is where we want to be. It\\'s clear. And if you\\'re telling me that Colfax Morrison are not appropriate places to have mixed use development, where is clearly a lot of residents are concerned. They\\'re adjoined to mixed use districts and that putting a lot of parking pressure on them. Why are they living there? It\\'s a mixed use district. There\\'s going to be tradeoffs. And so really, we need to be focusing on this particular bill to address the issue. You\\'re not requiring or incentivizing mixed use products. You\\'re saying this can be a one use product. Sure. You\\'re going to have a lot more parking if it\\'s only micro units because you\\'re not having this bill include or incentivize because the banks are only going to lend on basic, surefire things. And so unless the city is requiring the developer to do it, the bank is definitely going to go with the least risk and only lend on things that are a sure fire piece. So you need to be pushing the pressure on the developer to do what\\'s right to help affordability, to create these mixed use districts throughout our entire communities. Let\\'s see here. So that\\'s one piece of it. Deal with the existing zoning in these neighborhoods. Clearly, we have a lot of neighborhood plans. We\\'re working on new neighborhood plans. If this is an inappropriate zone, if the heights inappropriate, then let\\'s let\\'s work on that. Let\\'s not sit here and talk about parking. Obviously, if the mixed use district is not appropriate and again, most of these lots fall within existing mixed use places. So they\\'re clearly appropriate. So I don\\'t think that this particular bill is addressing the issue and really needs to have a lot more sustained, sustainable piece on what\\'s going on. So I oppose this. I think that staff red flag, we need a lot more work on this and I think it should be done. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Pryor. John Hagan. Hello, counsel. Thank you very much for your consideration tonight. My name is John Hayden. I am the president of Curtis Park. Neighbors, you\\'ve heard a lot from our residents tonight who have worked very hard on this because of the D line project that was proposed in our neighborhood. And I\\'m very proud of them for the work that they did. And actually over a year process, bringing us a development that that ultimately will get built, will be complementary to the neighborhood and will provide, I hope, affordable housing with fewer parking spaces. So that that actually ended up being a win. And I would like to say very clearly to those who are concerned about all these people coming to Denver and that that\\'s going to make the city worse, I believe it\\'s going to make our city better. The people coming here, the diversity of the people coming here is fantastic. And we need places for them to live and we need places for them to live where they don\\'t need a car to access everything, which is the one thing Curtis Park Neighbors Board decided not to take a position on this amendment, on this amendment. And the reason was because it didn\\'t it neither of the bills or the amendment fundamentally address what we believe is essential as you move forward to address, and that is that we need to have diverse, mixed use communities. In order for our city to be sustainable, people need to be able to access services by walking and biking and transit. That means that we need to have mixed use districts. What the amendment before you what that does not do is make any requirement that there be any kind of mixed use in our mixed use zones. So that\\'s that\\'s a big miss in our opinion. And so we did not decide to support or oppose it because we think it just missed the boat. So as you move forward, we hope that that will be something that city council can work on, that we make sure that we preserve our mixed use districts so that people can walk to services and that within those districts we have affordable housing. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Hayden. All right. This concludes our speakers and our time for questions by members of council. Councilman Castro. Thank you, Mr. President. Anybody from CPD that would like to. To talk? I have a few questions. Let\\'s see here. So the the project that brought this to everybody\\'s attention up on Humboldt Street, that is going to be about 104 units on two lots. Correct. Something of that nature. It sounds sounds right. Don\\'t have the exact unit count. Okay. So and they had zero parking requirements because they\\'re under the old. Ordinance, correct? Yes. They\\'ve been approved. And is that affordable housing? I don\\'t believe it\\'s needed as affordable housing, but they are small units. They\\'re all. But they\\'re not. It\\'s not an affordable housing project by any definition. The city has. There\\'s no tax credits. It\\'s not being sold at less than market value. Not that I\\'m aware. Of, no. Okay. So I\\'m wondering, do we have evidence that shows that if we don\\'t build parking, that developers are going to become kind hearted and sell their units at less than market rate? Or is this a supposition? I think the supposition is that surface parking on us, you know, a 60 to 50 lot takes up a lot of space, one in costs, you know, as a significant cost. And so when you factor those things together, you know, it trickles down to the affordability issue. But I can\\'t I can\\'t say I have specific statistical evidence that. I agree with that. The. The original bill was written in 2006. There is no way that bill could have envisioned 54 units on a lot. Right. I mean, is there any part of you that thinks that they planners were thinking about that back then? I think it\\'s evolved in the last ten years and there\\'s a lot of unintended consequences. Right. So as that being a baseline wouldn\\'t make a lot of sense for the reality that we exist in today. I don\\'t think. So I hear a lot of concern from CPD about how this affects affordability. So when this council. Passed the zoning for I think it\\'s about 100 acres of Arapahoe Square. Without any affordable component in downtown. As as fine a transit location as you could find with CPD concerned about affordable housing then. I can\\'t speak to that. Sorry. And I also would like to stand up straight and. Um, I may have one more. So and this bill, as I understand it, makes no requirement on any developer to provide. Car share. Transit passes or anything of that nature. Correct. Those incentives are already built into the code for for parking reductions you can get. So so they\\'re already there. But that\\'s not a mandatory thing with this bill as it\\'s not mandatory now. And my understanding is that Denver\\'s single occupant. Vehicle ride share has gone up the past two years. Am I remembering that correctly? Not sure. I see. Harris nodding. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Those are my questions. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Cashman. Councilman Cashman. And I just wanted to jump in on the wrap Hull Square piece. And, Sara, I\\'m a look at you, but we have no parking requirements in the proposed square, new zoning, because that issue came up. I was talking about parking requirements and housing. I just wanted to give further context. And in our zoning to date, we don\\'t have a mechanism for affordable housing, but it\\'s coming up at 30th and Blake. So stay tuned. I like your. Questioning. It\\'s a large part of this discussion, so I wanted to do drive it. That\\'s good. I see it. Councilman Clark. Thank you, Mr. President. Jeff, that can be. And sorry I can\\'t find the presentation that you had in our system. I\\'m sorry if I. If I misspeak, you can bring up the slide. I don\\'t know if it\\'s still in there or not, but I just want to. So. So CPD supported Councilman Brooks Bill before my amendments were adopted, correct? Yes. But is now opposing it because of my amendments? Correct. Yeah. I mean, that\\'s essentially it. Yeah. So on the slide and since it\\'s up here, we can bring it up. The justification for opposing, at least on one of the conditions was that it was not consistent with adopted plans because it increased the level of parking. Correct. Now conveniently, the slides after that showed one example that would have still been zero with Brooks Bill and would have been eight with my amendments. But add another story to that building. Add two more stories to that building. And Brooks number is not zero anymore. So there are circumstances under Brooks Bill that would have added parking, correct? That\\'s fair. Yeah. Yeah. So I that\\'s it\\'s it\\'s the tipping point and sort of that threshold, which is not, you know, you can\\'t get at a specific number. This isn\\'t super scientific, but but it did reach a critical sort of tipping point from our perspective. Okay. So talk to me about that tipping point, because I don\\'t see where you have outlined in a plan that it says adding parking is okay up to a tipping point. I see that it says adding parking is not consistent. They both added parking. That\\'s a little bit more parking. But that seems to me to be a very subjective decision that staff has made on what that tipping point is. Yeah, I think it\\'s the tipping point and part, which is a you know, it\\'s based on there\\'s any number of scenarios you could look at for how many parking spaces would be required depending on number of unit square footage. So it\\'s that sort of threshold that we looked at one but then also the, you know, the planning board process and recommendation and the steering committee process and recommendation that represented a compromise which wasn\\'t, you know, it was added parking to what we were sort of working with our baseline now. But, but at least from our perspective and others, feel free to jump up. It was all of those things combined in terms of the process leading to a compromise and our analysis of of, you know, how many additional parking spaces would be required if you take off a story. And we\\'re not digging into all that right now. I just I took particular issue, I guess, with the slide that said that you were opposed because my amendments added parking and I just wanted to clarify that I hadn\\'t missed something. Councilman Brooks proposal also added parking, but a subjective decision was made on staff\\'s point that cannot be directly linked to any adopted plan that tells us what that tipping point is, or that even makes mention of a tipping point. Yeah, I don\\'t think we have any plans that I would get into that level of detail at all. So no, we don\\'t. So again, I guess on this not getting to planning, we\\'re not getting anything else if there is no adopted plan. That says that or defines a tipping point. But South has made a decision. To oppose based on a tipping point. But then claiming that it is because of adopted plans seems to me like a little bit of a stretch. There\\'s also the VPN component as well. Yeah, we\\'ll get to that one. I\\'m just talking about opposing due to my amendments adding parking. When Councilman Brooksville also added parking and that was under the slide specifically saying that it is inconsistent with city wide plans, which means that somehow Councilman Brooks proposal was consistent with those same lines. Sure. So and I do think the zipline component is important that Jeff was going to talk about since you were talking about this particular topic. The only point I wanted to add, I think everything Jeff said was very on point. I guess two things. One is just to clarify, you know, is the the process to even look at amending this exemption to begin with was initiated by Council on the moratorium. And CPD has been trying to provide a technical lens throughout the process. And when it comes to and analyzing where the current amendment is, I think the tipping point that we\\'re talking about is I think we\\'d agree with you. I wouldn\\'t necessarily call it subjective. I think we\\'re trying to make it as objective as we could based on actually looking at parcels and what you can build on them. But where the tipping point really comes in and the plan analysis is also about preserving the pattern of small lots. And our concern is that the tipping point that\\'s being reached will encourage a lot assembly and go against our adopted planning policies of preserving that pattern and a kind of cherished attribute of the community. And I think we we definitely agree with you that there\\'s not a bright line or a clear objective. If there was, we probably wouldn\\'t have had to do this process because everybody would have been able to say, Oh, if we just apply this formula or follow the science, then we know the right balance. To make sure these lots can still be developed is x number of stories get exempted and you know, X number don\\'t we don\\'t have something that clear but our analysis was trying to get at when do you reach that tipping point where we\\'re afraid that the lots will not be able to have enough flexibility to redevelop and therefore we lose the pattern of those small lots? I guess still confusing because that analysis never said once you reach this number, so it should be added parking. But at this number there are instances even under bricks proposal with the certain number of stories that would have exceeded that. But you guys weren\\'t opposed to that. So anyway, I think we\\'ve hashed that one out. Getting to the zipline and maybe if Tina can come answer a few questions about that and then Jeff, if you want to jump in back to that. But so are there is there anywhere else in the code where your staff is required to review something that calls for less parking than would just be allowed? Yes. Yeah. So there are other places where staff is making a decision on how deep the discount or the reduction in parking should be beyond. City Council says yes to this and no to that, or our rules say yes to this notion there somewhere else where there someone is, there. Is an existing provision that\\'s been in the code. Since before 2010, it came into play in the nineties. I think that requires essentially a Z pin process. If a combination of asked for reductions exceeds 50% of the required to carry over, if I had to redo it today, I\\'d. Say. For the state. On the books right now, somebody could walk in tomorrow with the proposal asking for a reduction in or below 50% per those rules. Nothing to do with my lights and your staff. We you know. It\\'s not an all or nothing game. I mean, here you don\\'t get anything until you go through the Z process. And then somehow we\\'re supposed to come up with the number. It\\'s it\\'s if you all or nothing, you either get the exemption or you don\\'t. But if you want less than 50%. But if I get less than 50%. Gotten 50%. Off, reduce through. The code, and it\\'s a lot easier to understand the underlying intent that this had to be something pretty extraordinary to get more than 50%. We don\\'t have that kind of direction here. It\\'s do you get the exemption or do you not? And somehow this EPM process is going to tell us that we don\\'t think so. We could make that decision upfront if you would just make them subject to the exemption or not. Okay. All right. Those are my questions for now. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Clark. Let\\'s see. We had Councilman Lopez pop out. Councilman Flynn was first. Go ahead. Thank you, Mr. President. And actually, I want to thank Councilman Clark, because he asked almost all of the questions that I had about the inconsistency of recommending one, but not recommending the other when they both were apparently inconsistent. But one other thing, maybe, Athena, to expand on the the rec the recommendation that we deny this also because it provides for zip in, because it creates a false expectation for public input or whatever it was, the slide said. Can you talk about that a little more about why letting the public know what\\'s going on in their neighborhood is, well, something that\\'s going to create a problem? Sure. There\\'s no problem in letting people know. And we always encourage developers to do their their part to let the neighborhood know what\\'s coming and be a good neighbor. Whether you do it or not, there\\'s no code requirement for it. The zip bin. It\\'s not just that. It\\'s asking for public input. It\\'s a lot of steps, a lot of processing, a lot of resources to put out there, an opportunity to make comments to the city. And we\\'re supposed to take those comments and somehow use them together with the criteria in the code and come up with that decision. We don\\'t use the zip pin process to let people know about a project that something else. So we\\'re using a zip pin. From what I can tell, to give notice that this project is happening. But the zip code is supposed to be more than that. So it\\'s a bit of a misuse, I think, of a process without a lot of value added back. Okay. And I had a question for Karen, but maybe Tina, you can answer it since Karen\\'s all the way in the back. But if we vote no, if we follow your recommendation of vote no, then effectively we go back to total parking exemption. Correct? Okay. Thank you. All right, Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Yes, thank you, Mr. President. Cindy. I don\\'t know if you can. Come to the front. I. I just. I have a question. This may be planning in public works, and I just wanted to ask the status. So we talk about mass transit, modern day transit system, moving people. I know that we had. Discussions. And there\\'s just a lot of different ways and a lot of different plans that are out there that we\\'re working on a new No. One intimately. There\\'s just so much that goes by. I kind of. Forget where things are right now. And I was wondering if you can give us an update on the bus, rapid transit, the BRT plans today. Kind of an update on where that is on Colfax and if and if. And I don\\'t want to just I\\'m not just trying to put you on the spot. I\\'m just trying to get a little bit more information about where we\\'re at there. And I don\\'t know if CPD has been working with you to. Yeah, I\\'m by no means the expert. Hi, everyone. Cindy, Pat. Just generally just generally. Speaking, manager parking and mobility services in public works. And that is it\\'s not one of my projects, but in general, the conversation about. BRT Uncle VACS has been in progress for quite some. Time right now. The project is funded. For design, I believe, and is moving through that process, looking at environmental impacts and those types of things. Also looking at configurations and how the, the the transit service will most efficiently operate on Colfax. There\\'s, as you. Know, a go bond process happening right now talking about funding of different transit opportunities. There\\'s a number of different transit enhancement options on that list and that that list will continue to be reviewed as it moves. Through the go bond process all. The way until you all refer that list to the ballot in July, I believe so. Does that help? It does, aside from I know that we have, you know, some funding on Colfax on the bond. Should it, you know, move on to voters and be absorbed. So I definitely understand that piece in term and I really appreciate the update. But have we added any additional length because right now it goes from Yosemite? No or no? I\\'m sorry. It goes all the way from two to to 25 or something like that. And it stops at federal. The Denver portion. The Denver border. But it goes all the way to I mean it basically goes. To 20 to extend is certainly there but it\\'s related to the the funding and our partnerships with other jurisdictions. Cindy, we haven\\'t added any funding to go further west right to this date. I haven\\'t that I don\\'t. I don\\'t believe so. Okay. I just want to know if we made any progress, because this is something I brought up a year ago, and I\\'m not trying to put you on the spot. You\\'re just the messengers. I don\\'t want anybody to think that I\\'m trying to give her hell. I just the idea. I just want to know if we made any progress since our last discussion. And I know that there\\'s other folks that it\\'s their baby that they\\'re working on. So now I appreciate the the the answer that you have for me. Cindy Yeah, Mr. President, I just wanted to ask where we were, if there was any new plans or anything else because I. We can. Get you instantly been trying to ask for it to continue down to the other side of the city. We can we can have ask Gaby in the mayor\\'s office to get you some information through public works and CPD on that, folks who are working on that. Okay. Thanks, counselor. Olympic Council Lopez and Cindy, who works in parking. Oh, let\\'s get Councilman Espinosa. I actually didn\\'t have any questions until all the questioning started. So question. For staff. Did staff steer the task force away from or diminish the request to add to add xp-pen did diminish a request by members of the task force to add zip in language because of policy. Yeah. You know, that was Councilman Brooks\\'s committee. We weren\\'t in a position to do anything steering. Were there more from technical. So. So I can I can answer that. I think the conversation did come up and in all honesty, I think staff did push back and said this would create some issues for A, B and C reason. But the committee did have that conversation. Okay. When engaging the public for input and having community input on zoning challenge changes, the CPD policy framed the discussion. If so, God help us on anything. On what makes the Blueprint Council recommendations or what gets me followed through on by the agency? Is this a question or is this a comment? Yeah, we have policy and I have seen this happen before, which is there might be a good suggestion, but it\\'s not consistent with policy, not the law. The ordinance, my new policy. So our our staff is reviewing this task force recommendation and what gets printed and shared with the public. Same with the you know, larger issues is policy driving what is and isn\\'t basically put out there for public consumption and consideration. Well, the only policy we have to stick to the Tex amendment criteria and in the code and and that does point to citywide policy. So that\\'s the only policy we\\'re really looking at. When we were making our recommendation. We\\'re talking about change, changes to adopted ordinance. And when we when we open a task force out to to both developers and the community and we get this this thing, and we try to achieve consensus, the idea is, is that we open it up completely. And if that means depend, what, like it or not, we should be considering that, shouldn\\'t we? I think that all options are on the table. Okay. So, you know, we\\'re talking about 11 small parking exempt projects in eight months. The public expectation is that the zoning administrator is comfortable enough customer and competent enough to make a decision regarding the impact of development on existing context. Council Knowing the skills of our staff. Councilman the people up to the task and the 11 projects were prior to. This process even starting. So please keep it to two questions. You got plenty of time and comments. Councilwoman Sussman. Thank you, Mr. President. I\\'d like to ask Joel Noble to come up. I have some questions. But he should. You know. Thank you, John. As you as you know, I have a lot of concerns about this. These bills, not the least of which is concerns about developmental on Colfax and how much we\\'re trying to support new neighborhoods serving development, but also in federal and other places are Main Street places. Can you address what you think this amendment might mean for the sort of the small lot, the concepts that we\\'re trying to promote? Or I guess it was more that we heard it was that for small, smaller patterns. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for inviting me up. I wasn\\'t planning to speak tonight. I\\'m happy to speak to you on my own behalf, my own opinions. I do serve on the Denver. Planning Board, but. Based on the Denver Planning Board bylaws, I can\\'t speak on their behalf. So. Right. But I\\'d welcome your opinion. Okay. I try to listen pretty carefully to public sentiment. What are people interested in? What are they interested in preserving? What are they interested in defending against? And in the zoning code update process that I followed very closely with Councilwoman Madison. I heard a lot of people in the public concerned about preserving the pattern of small lots of small buildings, whether they\\'re new buildings or old buildings. That character along the street and this parking exemption as a tool prototyped on Colfax to preserve that by not requiring more parking than can actually be fit on the sites was viewed as pretty successful just a few years in. And the zoning code the zoning code update process extended it. And when we look today about frustrations that we hear in the public, one of the frustrations we hear is we\\'re losing the character. People say things are ugly and new development is too big. It\\'s out of context. It\\'s changing the character. So it\\'s been of particular surprise to me throughout this process that there hasn\\'t been more discussion either in the public or, frankly, at council about preserving that small character. Instead, we have a proposal here that while talking about parking and whether we believe people will have a car or not. And talking about supply and demand, fundamental supply and demand issues. If you produce more housing, then there\\'s more supply and the price should come down for a given amount of demand. Nobody\\'s really talking about the preserving the small lot character. I brought with me CPD produced an analysis on a sample project, the same sort of sample project they showed earlier of the amount of parking spaces that would be required for a sample project under various scenarios, how much is exempt, etc.. And in nearly all the cases in the scheme, zoning, which is the Emacs, is the most common of any of the zoning that any of the small lots have. Far more parking is required that can be fit on the site. 16 spaces, eight spaces, 2448 depending on the mix here. So it\\'s obvious that if something can\\'t fit, it won\\'t be done. If if you can\\'t fit 24 spaces on one of these very small lots, you\\'re not going to you\\'re going to do one of three other things. You\\'re going to let it go. And we don\\'t get revitalization. Things stay dormant. And that\\'s a problem we have on Colfax quite a bit. And throughout the city, you\\'re going to tear down every other building, right? So redevelop this building. Redevelop this site. Tear down the one next to it. To park it. Because I\\'ve met my parking requirements. And I got to tell you, when that happens, the public isn\\'t happy because they\\'re like, what happened to the character of the street? We have these parking lots, every other one, or you\\'re going to assemble several lots together and do a much bigger building. That means you have enough space to provide all the parking. And then the public is going to say, what happened to the character of our small lot pattern. So I really regret the way this conversation is going because I was part of the conversation leading up to 2010, and I know that people who think about design and regret the changes they see happening in the city are going to regret the inevitable either lack of preserving the small lot character or stagnation or the missing teeth . The fact that we\\'re going to get if this passes. Thank you. I was going to use that missing teeth analogy, too, because I hear it from developers. And when you have the missing teeth along a street, it discourages any new kinds of concepts going on. I appreciate and thank you very much, Joe. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilman Espinosa. You have a question? Yes. Jones, come back up. Since. Since Mary Beth put you on the spot and might as well ask you the question related to what was already discussed. If the if the recommendation of the task force and I mean, are you from. Let me first ask are you familiar with were you here for the entire staff presentation today? Yes. And then are you comfortable and familiar with the proposed text amendment that\\'s on the table today? I\\'m familiar with it. Are you asking if I\\'m comfortable with it? No, I\\'m familiar with the actual language. Yes, yes, yes. So if that language were the recommendation of the task force and presented to the planning board, given the criteria of planning board. Is there any reason why Planning Board would not have recommended approval? Again. I can\\'t speak to Planning Board, but I\\'m happy to talk about the topic of the criteria because a couple of months ago, when the moratorium was going to be extended, a comment that you made about the criteria of who caught my attention, you said that the criteria that the staff report was reviewing and the planning board reviewed is different than the criteria the council reviews, which actually is not correct according to the zoning code, the criteria is exactly the same. It wouldn\\'t make any sense for planning, board or staff to to weigh in on criteria different than the criteria that you\\'re analyzing. So the key criteria in a lot of these things is consistency with adopted plans. And if you read the staff report and you read the the letters that were sent in from the people who did speak to that, including Ken Triple A, professor of Urban Planning. It goes point by point through all the things in Blueprint Denver that argue for the kinds of diversity you can have when you lower the parking requirements. And I couldn\\'t find anything in my analysis for the planning board work that argued for increasing parking requirements. And so today, you\\'ve got staff saying to you that they don\\'t find this proposal consistent with adopted plans. A planning board we had to look at, okay, how inconsistent is it versus other goals? And the recommendation of the task force for me and I can only speak for myself that very, very popular three storey zoning, very neighborhood compatible, keeping the small lot character at the three story zoning was the tipping point to Councilman Clark\\'s comment. The fact that Councilman Brooks proposal, when it\\'s near transit one, is that the places that can best support people\\'s ability to live a car for your lifestyle if they choose to. And if a developer chooses to provide that product, that was a good tipping point to say we\\'re providing a diversity of options, meeting all the goals and blueprint Denver well enough because you can still build that very popular three story product on the three story zoning, which I think is the most common zoning where these small lots are found. When you go beyond that and to your point, if if today\\'s proposal had come to planning board, I can\\'t speak for anybody else, but I would be very challenged to find it consistent with Blueprint. Denver That\\'s interesting because most of my point when I spoke at the planning board were on the the argument about density and units per acre that are very much part of Blueprint Denver But nowhere in our code which this does not go to to addressing which has dramatic impact because 54 unit project on a seventh of an acre is 240 units per acre, which is not at all representative of single family duplex zone districts that are areas of stability where the councilman. So to that, I asked you to sort of consider the language it by itself and all you did was a comparison which that in fact occurred at planning board as well. Because Councilman Clark\\'s proposal was mentioned in the the comments from Planning Board were very clear to sort of put, put put down that suggestion. But I\\'m asking is if if this if this this still represents a reduction in parking requirements over any base zone district. So is the criteria that is met. I mean, that needs to be met in order to get planning board approval is the criteria met by this ordinance or we now. So if we approve it, are we in violation of our own criteria? I probably can\\'t do any better than planning board itself did. And because Planning Board recommended of the original approval of the original proposal approval with a condition that the parking requirements not be further increased because in my opinion it would reach this point where achieving the goals and blueprint Denver of having a variety of housing options and having a variety of being able to live with or without a car would be compromised. Staff\\'s staff\\'s report today, I think, emphasizes that. Okay. Thank you. All right. Thank you, gentlemen. As soon as was Councilwoman says. Yes, sir. Mr. Hickman, I have a question for you. If you could come to the podium. Mr. Hill. Yes. I notice that you\\'ve been attending our geo open transportation and mobility meetings and very grateful for that. And in all of the volunteering you have done on this issue. Well, I attended one this last. The last one, which was a very important one that\\'s. Stimulating. That\\'s for sure. And we had many we had several speeches by the can travel that was mentioned. And Jill Lo can talk about our need to consider how much we subsidize cars and particularly single occupancy vehicles and how the experts and the people who are studying this says we have to think very, very difficult situations about are not subsidizing car use as much as we do. And as I was watching you, I was wondering, I wonder what Mr. Hickman is thinking about this in terms of the small parking exemption issue that I know you\\'ve been promoting. Wow. Do you really expect me to answer that? Yes, I. Do. By midnight? Well, maybe in about 2 minutes. 3 minutes. Thank you. The issue, of course. Is that anything we do? Needs to be weighed against the resources that we take to do it. Okay. At the root of this issue, I think, is the fact that people still own cars. We hope, and I\\'m one of them. We hope that people will own fewer and fewer cars in the future. I think I said that earlier tonight. But meanwhile, the reality is people have cars. We have to store them somewhere. And our streets have only so much capacity for anything. And I think one of the last things. That we need to do is to use that right of way. That was discussed a lot in that meeting. For more parking that right away is there for other uses that would be much more beneficial and advantageous to the citizens of Denver? Does that does it help? That\\'s a really good and I appreciate that response and I thank you for attending. So thank you. Thank you. Do you have time for a small joke? No, I think that\\'s only in common. I will. Yeah, I\\'ll answer for no, she doesn\\'t right now. Councilman Lopez. This is mine. It\\'s my. Got it. Did you have did you have some. You know what, my. I do, but for the next four comments. Okay, great. I\\'ll make my comments. Great. Couple questions. I think we. First of all, let me just ask. Just raise your hand if you are a developer in the room. Okay. Great. And the deadline, folks, that they leave already. Okay. That\\'s unfortunate. Okay. We\\'ll go on to common sense. Let me. Where\\'s my. Oh, there\\'s my gavel. Okay. The public hearing for 161 is now closed. We\\'re going to comments. Councilman Clark. Thank you, Mr. President. This has been a long haul, and we\\'ve been beating this one up a lot. You know, I\\'ll start with once again thanking you, Mr. President, for taking this on and for also being open to disagreement and conversation and evolution and and and helping me along the way with how I worked things that that you didn\\'t agree with. And so I think that is an important part of our process up here. Councilman Hurd did not hear what he always says. We can disagree, but that doesn\\'t mean we have to be disagreeable. And I think I take that with me and I just really appreciate how you have led us on this issue . I also want to thank staff sitting here in the front row tonight. I know it\\'s not easy dealing with us up here, and we\\'re a cagey bunch of crazies. You quote me on that one, and I just want to say thank you again. We get heated, we get into this, but at the end of the day, you guys have the hardest job in the world trying to balance all of this and all of us who have very different feelings. You know, a couple of things that I just want to say that I think that, you know, very quickly to go through the stuff that I touched on in questions, I was asking questions about if you want to develop on a small lot with no exemption, there\\'s no zip in. You can go to vote if you want the exemption, there\\'s zip and that gets you down to a very low percentage of parking. If you\\'re on a bigger lot and you want to develop without going below 50%, there\\'s no zip in the joint, less than 50%, there\\'s a zip. And it sounds to me like a very similar process. I am eager and I wish that, you know, I hope that we can we can move forward. And if there are ways for us to define it more down the line, that makes it easier for staff. I would be happy to take that on, too. I wish that, you know, somebody from from the zoning administrator\\'s office might have reached out and said, what would that have looked like? Rather than just you\\'re not doing it? And so it\\'s hard. So for me, that to me, Xp-Pen is so important to this. And to me it doesn\\'t seem that out of line with what we already do. It\\'s new and different territory here, but that doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s a bad thing. You know, I also, again, want to point out what I pointed out a lot of times, that my bill isn\\'t the only bill that adds parking. The bill that was put on the table added parking. And I do think that that tipping point is is tough. And so I guess I\\'m not saying that I think CBD necessarily should have supported the bill as amended, but I\\'m just not also sure that you should have supported Brooksville based on the same some of the same criteria that you looked at on mine. What\\'s really important to me at the end of the day is that support or not support. We\\'ve had a really robust conversation and we moved something forward that can be good for the for our communities. I also, you know, understand that this bill, as amended, does make CPD and public works and everybody a little bit nervous. And honestly, I think that\\'s a really good thing right now because since we doubled down with our second vote on these amendments a couple of weeks ago, I have had more awesome conversations with staff about how we are going to move very quickly on TDM and and you know all the things at the very beginning that were said about parking management and TDM and all these great things. And so I think that this puts us in a place where it\\'s not perfect, but it does put us heading in the right direction. I wish that tonight we were talking about a bill that was all about TDM and multi-modal improvements and parking management. I wish we would have been talking about that since the beginning of this process. Not getting really excited about at the end when we\\'re getting nervous about what\\'s going to happen. I wish that we were talking about incentivizing mixed use as part of this. I wish that we were talking about context, sensitivity and what works in downtown might not work in the highest point in Denver and District two. And to be very clear, I don\\'t love this bill. This bill is not my baby that I am so excited about. I think we have a lot of work to do. I don\\'t think this is a perfect solution, but I do think it\\'s a good start and I think it\\'s a good start that brings the neighborhoods, the ones who are experiencing this firsthand and not theoretically and not from a book, but in real time, in real life in the world that we live in today, not the future condition. It brings them to the table to say, this isn\\'t perfect, this isn\\'t what we wanted, but it\\'s a compromise we\\'re willing to start with. And I think some I can\\'t remember who said it. I\\'d give you total credit, but somebody said, Well, you know, if everybody in the room, there\\'s nobody in the room who is really like, yeah, this bill, right? That means we\\'ve probably landed at a pretty good place for compromise. I feel like this is a good start. It\\'s a good compromise. It\\'s much better than a full exemption, which is where we are going tonight with the no vote, no vote go takes us back to full exemption. And so I sincerely hope that this is the start of the conversation, not the end of it. And I would ask my colleagues to please vote yes on this good compromise so that we can start the process of moving forward. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, President Pro tem clerk. And I\\'m just going to go down the line because we we got them lining up, you all. And I don\\'t know how you came in. So. Councilman Espinosa. Thank you, Mr. President. I second Councilman Clark\\'s comments for working with this body and allowing us the space to voice and address the concerns of our constituency, especially those impacted as yours, mine. And Councilman Clark\\'s is speaks well of your leadership. And thank you. We are not listening. So I can tell you all that this that I don\\'t have consensus support of even this amended version for my R.A. It still doesn\\'t get there. As many of your comments mentioned, no consideration for true mixed use development, transit alternatives or affordability, but it\\'s a good compromise and hammered out amendment. And so with that I\\'ll be supporting it. But I wanted to speak to a few things here. A speaker mentioned how they\\'re already built. Existing unit went from 1300 dollars a month to 1700 dollars a month after she moved out. In one day. It was it was re rented. The cost of that building did not go up because of the parking requirement on that project. It was an existing building. The rental market isn\\'t being driven by parking. Ironically, the new zoning code has always had parking reductions for projects with affordable units, given the expressed difficulty demonstrated by staff to capture some of the required parking. Maybe, just maybe, savvy developers seeking square footage for development would look to those affordability reductions or reductions for alternative transit to resolve design challenges as they meet on these small lots to council and clerk\\'s observations. In the Q&A, staff claimed that the amended amendment is inconsistent with Blueprint Denver requirements related to parking. Mind you, at the time that that was adopted 15 years ago, all areas were subject to Chapter 59 zoning regulations. At the time of Blueprint, Denver Tennyson Street was zoned before that, zoning would require multifamily development to provide one space per dwelling unit. The impact is easy enough that impact is easy enough to figure out. However. If one wanted to build a structure for a brewpub, an eating place or retail, the parking requirement would be required at a rate of one per 200 gross square feet. That is. Is. It\\'s the fourth category. Sir, if anyone is interested in chapter 59. The entire first floor in and of in our current amendment, the entire first floor is exempt over 6250 lot which remains exempt with this amendment. And we\\'re one of those commercial uses on in that old chapter 59 zoning code that\\'s 31 required spaces. That\\'s now exempt. We had mapped. Had we mapped to mass or zoning without small lot exemption, we would have been consistent with Blueprint Denver then. That is a massive reduction and we are now period. If the recommendation of President Brooks\\'s task force were the language we have today. The criteria of the planning board would in fact be met. And would be recommended for approval. There is nothing in this amendment that doesn\\'t meet that criteria despite what is being said on the city staff. So I\\'m disappointed that the director of CPD has wasted so many precious staff resources defending the President\\'s text amendment on a fraction of 1% of the developable land in this city. Those are resources that could have been working on helping fund transit through development of transit demand management policies or land value capture. We could and should be 60 days into that future. Mind you, I now know that we are in fact, working on that. Thank God. But I\\'ve been talking about that specifically to the managing director of CPD almost since the day I got here. So I wish we were voting today on TDM Inland Value Capture because those are the tools we were presented long ago. The case was made that when we re zoned in 2010, we did not have restrictive enough basis zoning. So some of these assets that we\\'re trying to make are going to be harder and heavier lifting because we have already massively reduced the parking requirements in this city. That is the model that other communities are looking at. Our base zoning without exemptions. In fact, to the point about cities not making parking, increasing parking requires Boston, South Boston just three months ago increase their parking requirements from 0.9 units per I mean point nine spaces per unit to 1.5. Why? Neighborhood preservation. So there is a give and take here. I\\'m totally on board with getting zero mean 100% parking exemption, but we need have to have the tools and the keep and skills adopted by this city and put in place so that we can get there in a more managed, thoughtful way. And so with that, I will be supporting this amendment because I think it\\'s as good as we can do right now. Thanks. All right. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Lopez. Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, let me just. Let me thank you for all of your work. Also. You are very passionate. You stayed on top of this. You. Convene a lot of people. And I, you know, in the light, the last vote that we had on this bill. You know, I. I saw the disappointment that you had. I don\\'t want you to think for 1/2 that this is a critique of your work or your work ethic or your leadership. I think, you know, I say this and I know my my colleagues and the folks around us know how hard you work. And I wanted to commend you for that on the floor. This is a tricky issue. And why. You know, I kind of felt conflicted going back and forth. And what it did is. For me, it\\'s allowed me to take a look at how this would apply to them. To my area a little bit. A little bit more. And I cannot. So I did. I was able to engage with more of my constituents, with folks across the city and kind of compare the two. And I know this song and I feel like the Rolling Stones I need to sing sing the same song with the same kind of excitement as it did the first time. Right. So it\\'s a little tricky, but it comes across it actually is pretty, pretty good. I\\'m looking at Paul Cashman and I know he\\'s looking at me real skeptical. I think I want to poke fun at the Stones. I\\'m not. So that\\'s how it comes across. I\\'m glad you\\'re laughing. So. So is laughing at my joke. So I say this because. I the the woman that got up, I don\\'t know if she\\'s still here, but she got up and said, you know, these are family grew that child and they\\'re looking for a place that was like 1700 a month. I can\\'t help but think. Come West. There are some places in Barnum and we\\'ll park in our neck of the woods on the west side that are that are about that budget. And you\\'re going to get a good a good unit. I mean, you\\'ll get three bedrooms with your own driveway and your own yard for about that much. It\\'s still expensive, still absolutely expensive to live in Denver, no matter where it is. Everybody\\'s getting squeezed out. I. I paid a lot of attention to her because I\\'m wondering why she hasn\\'t come west. And when I ask people, well, why out here? Well, it\\'s not as connected. And it\\'s the same answer I\\'ve gotten. It\\'s not as connected. And then I go back into my neighborhoods and I don\\'t need to go back. I mean, I\\'m from the neighborhood, I. Eat, sleep. And I mean, JJ is man, I was a pitcher. He was a third baseman. We were on the same team, literally in Little and Little League. Not much has changed on our side of the river. And even with plans. And I wanted to make sure that that that. Cindy didn\\'t feel attacked when I said this. I just was honestly looking for an update. Cindy\\'s an amazing visionary over our public works. You are. But it goes back to American if we were. So there\\'s two ways this is framed. One is affordability, the other is mass transit. This whole argument for or against? And this is why I\\'m going to tell you why I\\'m supporting this bill. I supported this amendment because. If we were so engrained in wanting to make this happen in multi-modal city happen. The BRT would be without question. On the West Side. It\\'s not even funded going past federal boulevard. We had to fight for it just to come across the river. I was told a million times you couldn\\'t put it on Colfax or the Hill. It\\'s heavy, you know. Well, they usually there\\'s trains in San Francisco, so. If a kitchen can exist in San Francisco over on a on a steep grate again in Denver. And then. Just the planning and we are looking at. West Side kind of the neighborhood plans and bringing him up to speed. And these are plans that were done that were created all about the car and it was all about just driving everywhere. These are plans from the eighties and nineties. They\\'re not going to get touched until 2019 according to the phasing that that they\\'re working on in CPD. I won\\'t even be a councilman. And we\\'re all about it. We want to start now, but we just don\\'t have the capacity to to do it. We don\\'t have the staff to actually get it done. So that and then, you know, I came to this council a year ago with a simple amendment to the budget to ask for to for a block of sidewalk. On South Florida, on the west side, southwest Denver. $170,000. I mean, it\\'s not it\\'s not cheap, but it\\'s also not going to break us. That request was denied. I couldn\\'t get more than four votes for that. So where is this multimodal city? I\\'ve been hearing about. Not in the West Side. Now we\\'ve been pushing to give some folks in credit. We\\'ve been pushing. But the bike boulevard that we needed implemented. They said we\\'re going to implement of Denver\\'s first bike boulevard four years ago. We still don\\'t have it. I\\'m seeing it all built out and striped all over this place down here. We\\'re not getting it over there. So I don\\'t buy this thing about well, we want to make it so that you can get anywhere. Well, apparently not in the West Side. That\\'s what we\\'re fighting for. And look, I\\'m not it\\'s not a critique on our staff. It\\'s not a critique on the people that make it work. It\\'s the critique on our priorities as a city, in our budget, what we\\'re not willing to fund. The other thing is affordability. I don\\'t think this this isn\\'t an issue about affordability, folks. Seattle. Portland. People that are kind of there with it. They still have an affordable housing crisis. You look at other cities with equivalent or higher parking requirements that are more affordable. Denver. Phenix. Albuquerque. Salt Lake City. Dallas. Columbus, Ohio. This exemption has been around for 6.5 years. You think that\\'s made a dent in our affordable housing crisis? It hasn\\'t. And also go take a look at some of these micro units. Column. Pretend your. Your. Your. I\\'m trying to be cool, like. Get in there and be like, hey, I want I want a unit and I don\\'t want to share anything. I\\'m a millennial, whatever. Right? Well, I want to share everything. I\\'m millennial. I want a small unit. IKEA couch, whatever you call them. Asked what the month to month rent is 1300 dollars for 400 square feet. Are these really affordable? Are these families? And if that\\'s what we\\'re incentivizing. On these in these locations and. How is this going to increase affordable housing? And, you know, one of our to give to give is to bring something out and don\\'t want to be to I don\\'t belabor and I\\'m sorry, but I really need to make this point because last time I was conflicted. Somebody on our council said, Well, why don\\'t we? Why don\\'t we all walk or bike or transit for a whole week? To work. For Joel. That was you that said that for Joel and John\\'s the guy that has taken all the heat saying the call in the parking council. I mean, he\\'s the only one biking down here. All right, I\\'ll tell you what I would, but I have a daughter to pick up after school and take to her after school program. I have a mother to go leave dinner for who lives outside of Denver. I got to do that every single day. I can\\'t do it on a bicycle. I can\\'t do it on the 16. And let\\'s try. You know, this is fine and dandy when it\\'s when it\\'s warm outside. But what happens in the winter? So this is why I supported the amendment and this is why I support this moving forward as until we are there. I\\'m not there. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Councilman Lopez, Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. And what a joy this meeting is. And if you want to get up and stretch your drinks and poison whatever it would take to make you feel better, please feel free. So you know what? I\\'ve said this before, so excuse me if you\\'ve heard this before, but when people ask me what is my biggest surprise since taking this job, I always tell them two things. I tell them that my biggest surprise is how competent city staff is. By and large, I mean, when I was just another citizen out there at home reading the paper and watching TV and thinking people are idiots. They don\\'t know what they\\'re doing. They don\\'t care. And you see that once every how many years exposed because some poor parks worker was overtired and took a nap in his truck. And so everyone thinks everyone\\'s sleeping through the day. And you get you get inside the process a little bit and you realize how competent and how hardworking these people are. And people ask me about my council colleagues and I tell them, you know, we\\'re we\\'re obviously 13 different people, and it ranges from fairly conservative to fairly liberal . But we\\'re a very collegial group. I mean, we work together well. I think Councilman Brooks does a wonderful job as a whole as our leader this year in facilitating that collegial atmosphere. And the reason I bring this up is I don\\'t think any of us have done our best work on this process. You know, I think as as we\\'ve gotten into it, the topic has revealed itself to be more complicated. And I think it deserved more time and more more time in the weeds to I don\\'t know, you know, I believe that the staff is having fits over the idea of CPM. I believe they are. They\\'re seeing some real problems with it. And I think with more time, maybe it would be a different kind of pain and it would have different types of of of processes. But I believe we can make it work. You know, and I think, you know, we\\'re looking at these maps with the quarter mile, half mile areas around transit zones. I\\'m thinking, why are we getting off the transit corridor? Maybe we stay on the transit corridor. I\\'m concerned about Councilwoman Sussman and her concerns about Colfax. There are areas that I think we really need to pay attention to. But I for me, I\\'m just very clear what my constituents want. Want in or out of this process. You know, I think we\\'ve made some fairly mediocre sausage. You know, if I were ordering breakfast at Sam\\'s three and this was the sausage, I\\'d probably either ask for bacon or some cottage cheese on the side. We need to continue working on this. And also, I mean, I need to just reiterate, I mean, where people are sitting here with, oh, my God, you\\'re changing the world as we see it. It\\'s 1% of the lots in the city. Okay. 1% of the lots in the city. That\\'s not saying I\\'m satisfied with this. I think I\\'ve been clear. We need to keep working on this. No one\\'s happy with this. This is not doing what anyone wants. And, you know, affordable housing. Please, please, please. You know, I can get an affordable meal at the Brown Palace at Ruth\\'s Chris. At the fanciest restaurants in the city. If I want to go eat a potato and go home and call that a meal. That\\'s not to me, a meal. And a thousand 1213, 1400 bucks for 400 square feet is not affordable housing, you know, I mean, it\\'s it\\'s just not my definition of affordable housing. So I will. I\\'ll be supporting this sausage. You know, and Councilman Clark and I sat down with the director of CPD just because we wanted to exchange ideas and look for ways that we can figure out these remaining gaps. How do we get development on Colfax and protect the neighborhoods that I believe deserve being protected? I my my friend Espinosa, Councilwoman Espinosa said a few meetings ago that and I definitely empathize with this. There are people in these neighborhoods who have been building these great neighborhoods for decades. So let\\'s give them a wee bit of slack because they don\\'t want 104 units dumped on their block with no parking. I get I get I get the argument against. I\\'m concerned about the argument against. I always keep in mind when I\\'m assessing these issues and I get to the point where I believe what I believe. I always keep in mind I might be wrong. You know, I might be wrong. My vote might be the wrong vote. But this is the way I\\'m seeing it today. Thank you, staff, very much. I think you\\'re all incredibly talented people. So we\\'re at odds on this one. So be it. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Cash. Councilman Neal. Thank you, Mr. President. I echo the thanks to Councilman Clark and Counsel Brooks and also to Councilor Cashman. He filled in while Counsel Brooks was out and carried the ball initially, and it was part of the all the discussion with the group. So thank you for all your leadership on that. I also want to thank all the residents, you know, Bob and David especially and Margie. I mean, the analysis y\\'all did were just unbelievable. Every time you come in my office, you bring out some new analytical report and data that you accumulated. And it was so thorough and professional. I just really appreciate you helping us. Understand all the issues. That were around your mind and what was important to you and and your neighborhoods. I really appreciate that. I got really excited when City Pan came up because I thought City was going to lay out a transportation plan for us. But, you know, but but I knew she she was going to do her best to answer Paul\\'s questions. But we still don\\'t have that plan, and we hopefully will have it soon and look forward to it. I was I was glad when Councilwoman Sussman called up Joel. Joe, such a smart guy. And, you know, the planning board and and his kids comments about character are right on target with Colfax. We\\'ve been talking about that quite a bit for the last year or so, but I think it\\'s going to come down to a discussion about character and density. When we get to Colfax, it\\'s all going to be about affordable housing and density and and what\\'s going to happen to Colfax and Transit going down to the heart of Colfax. So it\\'s going to be a very interesting discussion. I really wish that we had that transportation plan and I really wish we had Councilman Sessions. Transit agency that she\\'s been talking about so fervently so. And she\\'s right on target. The city has got to have a transit agency to help implement that plan and and take control of our transportation system. So and if we had that plan and that agency, I think today would be a totally different discussion. We wouldn\\'t be talking so much about parking. I think we\\'d be talking about and developing and moving people around and possibly even getting people out of the cars. So so maybe that maybe that\\'ll happen one of these days. But I think what the alternate animated approach is a balanced approach. And so I can\\'t imagine it\\'s going back to to the old ordinance and and being totally exempt. So I think in my my constituents believe that to you know, I do surveys on all the major issues with all my constituents and I get about 800 to 1000 residents giving me feedback. And this was the highest I\\'ve ever had on a survey so far in my two years. And 85% of my Rosa said no to the exemptions. And but if they had a choice between three and, you know, council clerk and councilman Brooks it was council was Clark was the amendment they preferred so so I\\'ll vote yes tonight and I\\'ll encourage my colleagues to do so. And and like everyone said, you know, we got to keep working on this. We were this was just the start of this whole thing. And we\\'ve got to get transit and transportation solved and implemented in our city to become a great city. So thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Now, Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. I also want to thank not only my colleagues, Councilman Brooks and Councilman Clark, for their work on this. I want to thank city staff and folks from the neighborhoods on both sides that were. Passionate in bringing forth various points of views that helped us get to something that I think is an even better compromise. You know, over the years, as I have been involved in the land use process, city council clearly is is responsible for this. And it is not unusual to have a recommendation come out of the planning board that is not supported by city council. So, you know, and again, this is part of the deliberative process that we go through in listening to community and making sure that we\\'re trying to find that that, you know, important balance between the very and various points of view. You know, I can remember back when the chamber took a large group of people to Vancouver. And everybody came back excited about wanting to see more density in the city of Denver. This was before 2003 when we had, you know, ten members of city council leave. That\\'s when we started talking about density. And everybody kept saying, where we see density, we\\'re going to see affordability. Well in our large development, that hasn\\'t translated to affordability. So where you would think in large scale developments. Where we\\'re we\\'re, you know, seeing massive units being developed. We should see affordability, but that hasn\\'t been the case. So to expect that in small unit developments, you know, doesn\\'t mean that\\'s going to translate either. The other thing I think is important as we talk about the need for transit management a TDM for the core of the city, you know, we\\'ve got a great one out at Stapleton that\\'s doing great work. They\\'ve got businesses providing discounted passes for their workers. But guess what? RTD just did away with that discounted bus pass. So how do we make sure that there\\'s equity in the kind of work that we\\'re talking about so that people who are the poorest among us could afford to ride public transit there , the people who need it the most, and by and large end up paying more. Because when you look at, you know, the fact that, you know, government employees, the city discounts that pass for for for city employees. You know, there are other programs. But when it comes to folks who are at the bottom of the pay scale, they\\'re the ones that get hit the hardest with the affordable housing, the highest transportation cost. So we got to find something that works for everybody and doesn\\'t create this push out effect that says, you know, geez, your city, that we just can\\'t accommodate you. So you got to go somewhere else that you can afford. And that\\'s that\\'s the wrong message. I think we as a city should be working to address. So I\\'m going to be supporting this amendment tonight. Again, I think the deliberations that have taken place have been an important part of the process. And I appreciate the work that everybody has done on all sides of this issue. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilwoman Sussman. Thank you, Mr. President. I\\'m afraid I\\'m not part of this Kumbaya group. I\\'m going to probably be the first one to speak against support of this bill. It\\'s I I feel like Councilman Cashman does that. We are a very, very collegial group, and we do work well together. But we\\'ve had the leader of this bill say it\\'s not a good bill, but I\\'m I\\'m going to back it anyway. We had Mr. Cashman say it\\'s mediocre sausage, but I\\'m going to vote for it anyway. I just don\\'t know if that\\'s a sustainable way in which to vote to. Let\\'s not let\\'s make bills that we don\\'t like, but let\\'s vote for them anyway. I think that. Well, first of all, we\\'re putting a lot into 6250 square feet. And it seems actually it\\'s a small thing, but we have to maintain our principles and our vision and our ways for transforming our city. I think making decisions like this puts us on the wrong side of history. This bill moves us one step, a little step backward. We\\'ve had taken great strides. Couple of steps forward. But we have to keep. Pure to our ideas of what it\\'s going to take. To really turn around this city and get and reduce the amount of single occupancy vehicles. And there is lots of research out there about how to do that. We want a walkable, bikeable, transit rich city. Neighbors are concerned about congestion in the top three issues in my district are traffic, traffic and traffic. The only way you can move forward on something like this is to make really hard decisions that are unpopular with some and popular with others. But we have to stop subsidizing car use. With low gas prices. Low gas tax. Roads that are built primarily for cars that have for generations had the right of way before all people, these \\\\u00a33,000 things. And the other thing is parking requirements. It\\'s a huge subsidy for car users. Huge. We all feel like we deserve a free parking space. Our cars deserve a free parking space. Where did where did that come from? There is so much research out there how minimum rear parking requirements and the other subsidies are a major part of our problem with congestion. And to say it isn\\'t so. I\\'m going to just be kind of harsh here. Sounds like science deniers. You can say, okay, this is what they\\'re saying in the science, but I really don\\'t want to do that. There. There\\'s just no evidence otherwise and that we have to reduce our subsidy for cars and the way in which our our country is. And and I\\'m making all these, you know, grandiose statements on a little thing, you know, whether three stories get exemptions or two stories get exemptions. It\\'s a really small thing. But when you\\'ve got a plan and you have a transformative vision and you have a goal, you can\\'t let the little things slip by you. You can\\'t do that if you\\'re compromising your principles. The other principle that I believe in, too, is community input. Councilman Brooks ran a very comprehensive community process at looking at all the issues related to this, and they made a plan. I\\'m not sure. I wouldn\\'t have supported the original. Parking exemption for small lots. For all of the reasons that CPD did and the planning board did. But at least we had a community process and I know those people who were on that project or one are feeling like they were unheard. Where did their recommendations go? Why were they unheated? Why? And then I\\'ve even heard one say, why participate if you\\'re not heeded? I, I just wish that, you know, and I wanted to say our, our CPD leader took the time and our CPD people took the time to look at this because we asked them to we put a moratorium on this. And so they had to spend their time and resources on this because the council asked them to. And TDM is an important issue. I\\'m glad we\\'re talking about it, but it\\'s not just CPD, it\\'s public works, it\\'s housing, it\\'s it\\'s all of the agencies in our city. This particular 6200 feet, 60 to 50 feet has a lot to do with my Colfax issues and federal. It has a lot to do with affordable housing. It has a lot to do with the way we want our city to look. And it has a lot to do with equity in the ways we move around that. Pedestrians, bicycles and cars should have equal access to our right of way. They should have equal access. And that\\'s an important value. It\\'s probably not. As popular. But it is the science and I won\\'t be voting for this change. Thanks. Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilwoman Black. Thank you. I hate it that I\\'m next because I am so wavering. This has been the best public comment. Everyone here has had a very persuasive argument. And I really appreciate you all being here and being here so late. I\\'m very tired and I\\'m sure you are too, because I have a much more comfortable seat and thank you CPD. I\\'m very dismayed because I feel like there\\'s a lot of misunderstanding about the original parking exemption, which actually was about neighborhood preservation, and it was about small scale and historic buildings. And it does it dismays me that now it\\'s it\\'s if you\\'re support the exemption that you\\'re against neighborhoods because that\\'s not what it is. Just as Councilwoman Sussman just said. I also I feel like it\\'s turned into now a fight over who owns the street parking. And and that\\'s not what it was ever intended to be. And I also think it\\'s it\\'s not right that it\\'s somehow a developer against neighborhood, because that\\'s not what it is either. It was it was intended to preserve small scale buildings and not tear them all down and build a giant monstrosity like we have on South University in his district. Anyway. That said, the both the exemption and both of the compromises, the Brooks compromise and the Clark compromise were well-intended, incredibly imperfect, have unintended consequences. And they don\\'t necessarily solve the problems that they intended to solve. We need a much more pointed and neighborhood specific solution, as John Hayden, I think he already left and others suggested. Every part of our city is unique. There\\'s only one part of my district that has small lots. The rest of my district has more parking than we could ever fill. In fact, if you want to park in my district and I take the light rail into town, you should do it in. The one neighborhood that is impacted, however, is in undergoing incredible change and densification right now. And they support Dolan\\'s bill and have asked me to support it. Councilman Susman is right. Nobody is excited about it. Sue Glass Maker said it\\'s mediocre at best. Keith Pryor said this particular bill is not addressing the issue. We need to look at better ways to preserve small lots and encourage affordable housing and mixed use. I\\'ve wavered if I\\'m going to support it or I\\'m not going to support it. I think it\\'s going to pass. My I told you, my R.A. has asked me to support it. I. I don\\'t think the exemption has been successful. It hasn\\'t I don\\'t think it\\'s resulted in affordable housing. I think there\\'s been unintended consequences, Sharon Nunnally said. We can still work on it, and that\\'s that\\'s the spirit I like the best is that whatever we had wasn\\'t what we needed, but we need to all get together and find a better solution. So I\\'m still pondering this, but thank you. How could you be pondering after all this time? Okay. So. Councilwoman Black, thank you for your great comments. Council it, Councilman Flynn. Thank you. Sorry, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. I think I\\'m most distressed to hear that Councilwoman Sussman is going to destroy the Flynn corollary that I developed back in the eighties and nineties over at the press table that the longer we debated and talked and commented is seemed, the more unanimous the vote would turn out to be. So another another one bites the dust. All 13 of us up here, those who are present and the three who are absent tonight, have free, reserved private parking in the most transit rich. Node in all of Colorado. And to my knowledge, only Councilman Clark and I frequently use alternative modes, councilman bicycles, although he has that power assist battery. That\\'s really kind of cool. It\\'s a cheat. It\\'s a cheat. And he\\'s a young guy. He\\'s a young guy despite looking as old as he does. But and I take light rail, but I have to drive to Englewood because there\\'s no reliable transit for me to get to Englewood Station to come in. And and as Councilman Lopez mentioned last week, I did email all of us and said, why don\\'t we try to use alternative mode to come here in last week to see. Yeah. To get some appreciation for it. No one took me up on the offer and I regret to say that I couldn\\'t do it any day either because of the demands of my schedule to be here and there at certain times. I wish that we could be nuanced enough and nimble enough so that we could address the very legitimate concerns that I share with Councilwoman Sussman and along Federal Boulevard to try to maintain the character and the small parcels. I wish that we were nimble enough to to be able to address those without also suffocating the bungalows of Platt Park in West Wash Park by straight jacket ing them with the exact same one size fits all jacket. It seems to me that sometimes we argue for strict uniformity of regulation because we like predictability and certainty when it suits our ultimate philosophical purpose. But then when it doesn\\'t, we like to be context sensitive. I wish we had a context sensitive solution to this. I\\'m going to obviously vote yes for this, but I will work with every other member and with CPD to try to find a more flexible and nimble solution so that what works on Colfax but doesn\\'t work in Platt Park can still. Go ahead. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. All right. Councilman Cashman and Lopez. I\\'m going to go to Councilwoman Gilmore just to give since you guys already won. Okay. Lean forward to lean back. You got to lean back in that comfy chair there. Okay, Councilman Gilmore. Thank you, President Brooks. You know, listening very thoughtfully to all of the public comment and all of the the great conversation by my colleagues. The one thing that. Either. Bill really highlights is our enormous gaps in transit in the city. And it\\'s unfortunate and an equitable I think to pit affordable housing against. A failing transit system. When we\\'re also trying to maintain the character of our neighborhoods, because I think there\\'s a much broader and bigger conversation that we need to be having. And as it\\'s been said time and time again. It\\'s not a perfect solution. But Councilman Clarke\\'s amended bill is a compromise and what I hope is an interim solution. To this issue, but that we\\'re going to have to come back and address it again and again and again. The one thing that we haven\\'t necessarily talked about. In an intentional way is the equity question that this brings up, especially for my family who resides in the Monticello community. And I would love to take Councilman Flynn up on his, you know, challenge to take transit, to come to the city and county building. That\\'s not a reality for me. I have children who are in school who need to be there at a certain time. They need to be picked up midday. And so I just hope through all of the conversation that we\\'ve had here tonight, that we can elevate the conversation to one that looks at transit and affordable housing and a team plan from an equity lens, so that we\\'re making sure that we\\'re not only addressing certain parts of the city, but that we are truly being inclusive and including Councilman Lopez\\'s district and my district and all the people in in Denver. And that to have the privilege to utilize transit. You live in certain areas of the city, and unfortunately, that doesn\\'t always cover all the communities of color in the city. And so I hope that we can work more to broaden the conversation where it needs to go so that my three kids can choose if they want to own a car or not, that it\\'s not a necessity for them to own a car. And so that being said, I\\'m going to go ahead and support Council Bill 161. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilwoman. All right, Council Councilman Cashman. And thank you, sir. I will keep this brief, but I had to answer a couple of things. Look, I take this job very seriously. I don\\'t set out in the morning to make legislation that I\\'m not proud of. If it wasn\\'t clear enough, I support what I consider a mediocre bill because I consider the alternative poisonous. To go back to go back to a place with no parking restrictions, I think makes no sense at all so that the inference that somehow people are satisfied with mediocre legislation, I couldn\\'t let sit and to infer that we\\'re somehow science deniers. When this entire council. Placed as its number one budget priority, increased mobility and transportation. And then on this one issue that affects 1% of the lots in the city. We disagree. Makes no sense to me. I mean, Brother Murray has already tweeted out my sausage comment. You know, it makes and it makes an easy headline. I had done the same thing when I was writing, so. No offense taken, John, but yeah, I mean. Well, what I said before about the fact I don\\'t think we worked well together. You know, you have the legislative and the executive branches and there\\'s separation of powers. But we need to partner better sometimes. And I\\'m seeing another situation evolve that I\\'m interested in. Where I\\'m seeing silos when they are sometimes don\\'t serve us real well. So we need to work better at that. You know, I sit with the SAT, with Councilwoman Susman, with the mayor, urging him to form that Department of Mobility or Transportation or Transit, whatever whatever you want to want to talk about. So I think we have 13 people up here who are very clear on the need to improve transit, to improve mobility options, to provide affordable housing. And we\\'re just differing on this one tiny part of that discussion. So thank you and good night. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilman Lopez. You know, I realized I forgot a couple of things and I\\'ll be quick. I forgot the thing, Jawn, as well, too. Councilman Clark and Councilman Brooks. You know, for both of your work and your advocacy on that and just just on that tip. Councilman Cashman, look, the one thing I did not say, I mean, we complain about the sausage. But we don\\'t talk about how to make it better sometimes. So here are if you really want to go after affordable housing. Give somebody a living wage so that so rent doesn\\'t become an issue, for crying out loud. Let\\'s pay somebody a fair wage so that, you know, one month to the other they don\\'t get kicked out because they can\\'t make rent. Wages are still low and we have an opportunity to make that happen. And we we really have to put a dent in affordable housing that way. And just think beyond micro units. There are families. I want families to get on a transit route. I want families to bike together. None of us up here believe in a 1980s Denver where, you know, we\\'re pumping crude and filling up at the tank and the gas station and just driving around just for the sake of it. But we want to see this multi-modal Denver, but we want to see it equitably. Fully fund the BRT on Colfax. Playboy calls it the longest, wickedest street in America. That alone would be an awesome Ryan pundit. Right. Funny sidewalks. And not just with bond money, but it\\'s upon us. It\\'s our it\\'s us as council to say this is these are this is the money that we want to put towards our priorities. We can\\'t just make it a priority and a plan and have our awesome staff work on it are awesome, awesome city employees work on it and not fund it. We have the funding, right? That\\'s where. That\\'s where. Let\\'s put our money where our mouth is. The second thing and Councilman Brooks, you\\'re going to probably censure me after this. I was going to do that. But Denver\\'s Brooklyn Bridge, that Colfax Viaduct, and you cannot bike across it. Well, you cannot walk across it. Well, let\\'s transform it. It\\'s the one thing that has kept the west side and the east side from not being one city. That\\'s the biggest problem. Let\\'s fix the core facts via diet. You can bike, walk and drive and maybe even take the train across it to Bad Colfax being the longest street in America. The only way you can do it is driving. Let\\'s fix that. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. I think it\\'s the first time Playboy\\'s ever been quoted in a in a council meeting. All right. Read the articles. Council. Councilman Espinosa. Hopefully you won\\'t take off this time when I praise you. You\\'ll have to rewind the tape there. That\\'s all I\\'m going to do right now. And doesn\\'t necessarily need to be said, but. This is, you know, councilman or President Brooks. You heard your constituents. Express this concern. You took action. You led this moratorium process, you led that discussion. So it\\'s this is your bill. And you may not agree with the text amendments, but these words are your your words, you know, and you put this out and that directly in response to what you heard. And so it needs to be noted that this is not mean that that that is that is you doing your job, representing your constituents and us doing our job representing our constituents, trying to, to, to put this forward. So I whether it feels like it or not, I see this as the the the Brooks. Brooks Brooks. Clarke. Bill, because you got us here to a point where we\\'re talking about things and moving forward on that TDM discussion and all these things because we recognize that we don\\'t have the tools that we actually need to make. Denver This sort of pedestrian bike transit city that we know it needs to be. And so I just want to say that, you know, thank you for listening to those concerns because it would have been possible to not. And the fact that we\\'re here today, I just want to thank you topics. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. All right. We got some others up, Councilman Flynn and then Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. Just a brief note, because no meeting would be complete without some pointless historical trivia from me. But just to follow up on Councilman Lopez, the Colfax Viaduct originally was built with the Larimer Viaduct in an open in 1916, was built for Denver Tramway at a total cost of $715,000. Thank you. Built for transit, not for automobiles. Okay. Thank you, Councilman Flynn, for that. How much or how. Much concrete. History. Councilwoman Ortega. I\\'ll be really brief, and this is probably for a different conversation. But can we talk quality design? I think we should be ensuring that we have units that are going to last for generations into the future and not units that are going to be, you know, falling apart, that need to be replaced in, you know, five, ten years from now. So different conversation for different time. But it\\'s a missing part of the overall big picture conversation. Thank you. Thank you. In a plug for council. Councilman Espinosa\\'s urban design deal happening on Wednesday. If you\\'re if you\\'re not available to attend, send somebody who can. It\\'s a it\\'s a pretty interesting conversation at 12:00 in the committee. Okay. I\\'m going to be going to be the last one to speak is one of the privileges that you get as president. And this is a bill that I\\'ve been a part of. Councilman Clarke, thank you so much for working hard. It\\'s it\\'s as you can tell, we\\'re friends, frenemies in our district and we\\'re friends. And it\\'s it\\'s it\\'s so great to have very different perspectives on this small piece of legislation, folks, you know, come together and figure out a way forward. So I really appreciate you on that. STAFF Thank you so much. I know you\\'ve been through a lot and you\\'ve been great and you\\'ve provided some incredible information. And Ryan Winsberg, wherever you are in Portland, appreciate you to the committee that serves. Some of you guys are here. Some of you left this conversation a long time ago and when you started getting emails from people because people can be a little harsh and not realize the time that you put in. And so I just want to thank you all from for walking through that process. Councilwoman Jeanie Robb, who originally took this up in 2011. Thank you. And then to all the people who are still here at 915 when you can be doing a million other things, you are here because you love this city. Thank you. You went through security. Some of you pay for parking. And you\\'re sitting in hard, hard seats. And we really appreciate you. And we always respect the right for you to petition your government. It makes us better. So thank you, George. Mail. I want to respond to you. We are not having a conversation really with developers, and I will respond to a lot of emails that I\\'ve received that this is mostly developers and neighbors. I can count the number of developers who have been a part of the conversations in the last. Nine months. And it\\'s really neighbors and neighbors, neighbors that have a certain opinion around transportation mobility, neighbors that feel like we\\'re not getting there yet on transportation and mobility. So this is actually a very tough, complex issue because you can\\'t just make it black and white and make a quick decision. So I just wanted to say that Councilwoman Ortega is she drove home. My point and I appreciate you bringing in the urban design. I think that and I counted that\\'s the 11th topical issue that have been thrown onto this very little bitty deal called 60 to 50 lots. It\\'s less than 1%. Just so you know, not more not one less than 1% of our overall make up of 151 square miles. And I get it. There are a lot of issues in our city, but I believe we try to solve way too many things. And it got very confusing. We have parking issues in our city. We have urban design issues in our city. We have affordable housing issues in our city that won\\'t be solved with 60 to 50 square lot exemption. It won\\'t. But you\\'ve helped us to say we need to have outlets on urban design. We need to have outlets on affordable housing. We need to do this. We need to do that. We need to do TDM. You\\'ve helped us, but this isn\\'t, this isn\\'t gonna solve it. So. The last piece of this? Well, not really the last piece, but. I do have to point out something real quick because we had the affordable housing and folks got pooh poohed. And, you know, this is not affordable housing. Yes, it is. You know, all this conversation according to HUD. Income limits for 80% AMI units. Do you know what the price point is? Anybody want to know? $51,176. Most of these micro units are actually identified as 80%. Am I? So I\\'m not trying to drive home anyone\\'s point. I just I think it\\'s important to know that standard that if you\\'re at an 80% AMI, the max rent that you can charge in the city is $1,176. Okay. So the city of Denver, we pride ourselves, all of us, to putting forward, you know, progressive legislation and leading the nation in certain issues. We definitely do that socially. We rarely do that from a transportation mobility perspective. I think we\\'re starting to, which is really exciting. Unfortunately, both groups in the social justice part and even in the transportation mobility justice and and just they don\\'t talk. They don\\'t connect. And this is very apparent during this conversation. I feel like. We as a city can be doing much more progressive things around our transportation mobility issues. And it\\'s one of the things that have that has really come clear to me and have in this conversation and pushed me in some areas that I must be much more progressive in the way that I think around this . But I\\'ll be making my decision tonight on two things fear based over data driven analysis. I want to know what is the the 6250 development that has been built in this city. That is causing anxiety. We don\\'t have one. Now, there are some suppositions that could happen when one comes and we\\'re thinking about, Well, this will happen, but we really don\\'t have a development before. So we can study it and analyze and say, okay, because of this, we know that, and now let\\'s make a decision. My bill didn\\'t do that. Council. Councilman Clarksville didn\\'t do that. And I can\\'t support that. I think we need to go back to the drawing board. I love where Councilman Clarke is going and the team, but over. The conversations that I\\'ve had from both sides of my neighbors. I do think we need to go back to the drawing board. What that would mean is today if we voted this down. The moratorium. May 26, May 26. The moratorium is up. And we can have a conversation about where we go from here. But I\\'m just saying. I\\'m not going to put my name on this because I just there\\'s too many questions. There\\'s too many unanswered questions around it. And with that. Madam Secretary, roll call. Clark, I. Espinosa I. Flynn I. Gilmore, I. Cashman. Lopez. I knew. Ortega I. Susman. No. Black. I. Mr. President. No, please close the voting and announce the results. Sorry. I\\'m just making sure Black didn\\'t vote. Hmm. It\\'s in the system. There we go. Oh, my. Is it working. Or is, isn\\'t it? Shoes. Shoes. I need to wear this. Okay. Nine two. That\\'s correct. Yeah. Nine eyes, two nays. Council Bill 161 has passed as amended, seeing no other business before this body. We stand adjourned. Thank you, everybody.

Mr. President, I move that council bill 161 to 2017 be placed upon the floor. Final consideration to pass. It\\'s been moved and. I need a second grit. It\\'s been moved and seconded. Councilman assessment. Go ahead and offer your motion to amend. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that council bill 161 be amended in the following particulars on page three. Line eight. Strike the number two. Strike two and replace with three. All right. That\\'s the only change. Okay. It has been moved and seconded comments by members of Council Councilwoman Sussman. Thank you, Mr. President. I know that we\\'ve seen this bill a couple of times, and I want to thank Councilman Brooks and Councilman Joe Allen, who worked on this bill so diligently and continue to do so. I\\'m bringing what I hope is a friendly amendment tonight that retains some of the work that Councilman Brooks did and some of the work that Councilman Clark did. It retains the definitions of a transit corridor as a quarter mile and retains the definition of a station corridor, train station corridor as a half mile. It retains the lower exemption for development outside of these corridors to the first floor. It\\'s only changes to return to the three storey exemption for development within transit and train corridors. Change two three from the two story exemption. One of the big concerns that I mentioned about the lowering of this exemption within our corridors is the effect it could have on our efforts to revitalize Colfax and other of our main streets . Such as federal and Broadway. Lowering the exemption can frustrate our efforts to preserve the environment of our main street corridors where there are stores on small lots. On Colfax, we have the added barrier. Of lots that have very little depth. To meet greater parking requirements. We are incentivizing the preferred development that retains that Main Street feel of small businesses along what we hope will become even more pedestrian friendly streets. Development with this may have to create assemblages of several lots to meet the parking requirement and thus may be building larger structures that thwart the esthetic of these unique streets. We\\'re working hard on Colfax, many of us, to bring more neighborhood serving businesses to the street. Requiring more parking just makes that effort more difficult. I understand that people are going to come with cars. But I feel confident that we can leave the parking requirement to the market. People won\\'t rent or buy apartments if the lack of parking is a concern. And development will adjust to the market demand. Remember that we are not setting maximum parking requirements. Only minimums. The three story exemption is a significant departure from the original zoning that exempted all development on these small lots. Significant. For us in the communities who are seriously concerned about our dependance on cars and our city, state and countries. Historic practice of both subsidizing and incentivizing car use. I think the decision to lowering the parking exemption even further is antithetical to what our council has been encouraging for the six years I\\'ve been on council, and that is better pedestrian bicycle access and greater transit use. This is really a small change, but because of its considerable discussion and work. I believe it has big significance for what we stand for. And the significance to our work on transit oriented development. I asked my fellow council members to consider what it means for at least a good effort to be responsive to those special corridors in our city that we want to see retain their main street feel and meet some of our goals for a more livable city. I therefore urge everybody to pass this amendment. Thank you, councilman. Assessment. Councilman Clark, I see you logged in some just. Okay. Councilman Clark. Thank you, Mr. President. You know, I feel like we\\'re having a little bit of deja vu, because last week I read strike three and replaced with two. And so I\\'m you know, I think that we\\'ve hashed this out. We\\'ve had this conversation. The will of the council last week was to move from 3 to 2. And I guess I don\\'t see this as an amendment, but as a repeal of most of the work that was done last week. And that amendment I don\\'t want to get back into the all the reasons that I said I was bringing the amendment forward last week again, other than other than to say that, you know, in large part for me in my district, the zoning in these transit corridors is three story zoning. And having three floors exempt means that that\\'s a full exemption. And that was not why I supported the moratorium, was to take a look at this. You know, this this bill is far from perfect and has been, you know, a work in progress. But I feel that that going from 3 to 2 was a good compromise. And I stand by that. I would encourage my colleagues to to reinforce what we voted last week and defeat this repeal of the amendment that was offered last week. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Yeah, I would like the city attorney just for the viewing public, because this is already posted and we keep making amendments to explain to the viewers how it continues to be acceptable that we keep modifying things that will definitely impact communities within the posting period. Mr. President, you want me to answer? Yes, David. You can try to answer. David. Bravo, assistant city attorney. The there is no council rule that prevents you from revisiting and re debating something even when you voted on it once. In other words, you don\\'t have anything like a settled question rule. So the motion is in order to to go back and revisit the issue of two stories versus three on the issue of publication and posting. I\\'ve consulted with the other city attorneys in our office and consistent with prior advice we\\'ve given. You can stick with I believe it\\'s a May 1st hearing day. Do I have that correct? You can stick with a May 1st hearing date, even if if the motion is successful and is modified again to return to the three stories, it will not require reposting. Because traditionally we have advised that if in between first and final on a zoning a an amendment is proposed to make the regulation stricter, then you need to repost and move out the public hearing. But if an amendment makes the restriction less strict than current law or than the current proposal, then you don\\'t need to repost. So it\\'ll be possible if council chooses to pass the motion and to stick with the May 1st date and then the public hearing will occur on the proposal as amended. Great. Thank you for that. So then. Well, that\\'s that\\'s my only. Question or comment. And we\\'re. Both. So there\\'s only. Thanks for the clarification. The only other things I wanted to sort of point out is that the an even less restrictive law has been in place on Colfax for 11 years. And so if the goal is to now make this an additional change that is still more restrictive than what has been in place for 11 years, more restrictive sort of debate, the validity of that. But that said, again, I go back to having a third of these parcels in my district and the fact that this half mile transit corridor definition largely affects, you know, the bulk of it in my district is along the I-25 corridor, which isn\\'t a high frequency transit quarter, but that\\'s where the rail system is that serves District one. It\\'s on the other side of the railroad tracks and the other side of the highway. And I only have five crossings to get from District one to that rail. And of those five crossings, only two would sort of well, one pedestrian and one bike would sort of satisfy any sort of modicum of what is a desirable way of crossing the highway. It\\'s not 23rd Avenue that\\'s never been safe, but we\\'ve worked as a community time and time again to increase the rail height, to add guardrails , to to dedicate some bike portion. It\\'s only 15th Avenue and 15th Street and the pedestrian bridge. But the rest of my district is cut off, severed by physical impediments to getting over to the high frequency transit. And so when we do this sort of blanket definition of TOD as being this half mile radius, we\\'re not actually articulating what areas are truly accessible to those. Tods In the way that I think is desirable, a number of minutes traveled how safe that access is and what not. And so I\\'ve always articulated this should have been a mapped boundary where we made this exemption in this this without negatively having potential net negative impacts to communities that are very real and very present. And so, I mean, I\\'ve articulated that time and time again in different ways. So once again, I\\'m just trying to get would like my colleagues to recognize and understand that there are very, very real consequences to making this change to areas that are not truly served by high frequency transit corridors, but yet fall in the as the crow flies mapping of it. So I would encourage everyone to vote. No, thank you. Okay, Councilman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. I was pretty quiet last week when this came up. I didn\\'t make comments, but I just first want to thank you and Councilman Clark for initially working on this issue and Councilman Susman for attempts to try to, you know. Address it once again. But I guess what I want to say is that in this city, as we\\'re seeing development pressures all over the place. We are not a city that has addressed first mile and last mile connections. And until we do that, people will still drive their cars. Yes, we should do as much as possible to try to encourage people to get out of their cars and use transit. And if we were really serious about that, we would not be building a 22 lane I-70 corridor. But I\\'ll put that aside for a minute. So I think that as long as people continue to drive their cars, as they move into this city or already live here, they\\'re going to use their cars to go to the mountains. You know, if they can\\'t get to transit and I\\'ve talked to a number of people in Councilman Flynn\\'s district who, you know, may live half a block away from a bus stop. But that bus doesn\\'t get you down to transit to any of our train lines that could afford them the ability to get downtown. So we need to address that first mile last mile issue in order to encourage people to get out of their cars. I had an opportunity to go to Seattle to take a look at some of the micro-housing units that were being built there. We had met on numerous occasions with the developer of that project, who is also interested in doing development here in Denver. And, you know, their focus was attracting millennials to their development because they don\\'t own cars. Well, when we went and met with some of the residents, what we learned was a good number of them owned cars , and they were challenged with where to park them if they did any grocery shopping. When they came home, they had to walk three or four blocks away because there was no place in the immediate area to park. So as much as we want to get people out of their cars, it\\'s a reality that we are dealing with and it\\'s an impact that is imposed on the adjacent neighbors. So I think the the request that. Was put on last week that amended this bill. Is reasonable. And so I am going to continue to support that particular amendment that was made to this bill. And my hope is that\\'s what we have the public hearing on. So for all those reasons, I will not be voting for the amendment tonight. Okay. Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega, a jump in because this was my bill that presented for. No, it\\'s Clarke\\'s bill. This has been this has been we\\'ve talked about this a lot. And there\\'s a lot of issues around this. And I really respect Councilman Clark in the conversations we\\'ve had around this and the folks that he\\'s representing on this very important subject. And I just see councilman new poppin. Go ahead, Councilman Neal. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Sorry not. To. Press the wrong, but I really appreciate what Councilwoman Sussman is talking about, because we\\'ve been working hard on Colfax redevelopment, and I\\'m looking forward to seeing that prosper and be a wonderful street that\\'s going to be full of affordable housing. And people won\\'t need a car. But I\\'m also worried a little bit that we haven\\'t had enough discussion about this whole issue. You know, I think we extended the moratorium and was hoping that we\\'d have a little more discussion because I\\'m still getting a lot of feedback from our residents about the provision of the bill that\\'s talking about the exemption and other new developments that are beyond their the quarter mile. And in in areas of the neighborhoods and especially got an area in Congress Park the 12th Avenue this you know it\\'s about a half mile from. It\\'s not a rail station, but it\\'s it\\'s a corridor. But maybe it\\'s walkable to transit on Colfax. But again, there\\'s mixed use there, small or large, that they could be developing and may not be good for the character of that neighborhood. So I\\'m really concerned about about this sort of support, the three stories for Colfax, but I\\'m not sure that\\'s good for the whole city. So I\\'m really torn from from what all my constituents are telling me about the need for less exemptions from parking. So I look forward to hearing more discussion and I hope we\\'ll have more discussion about this. And unfortunately, I think I\\'ll have to vote against the the amendments. And I. Okay. Thank you, Councilman New. I\\'ll just say that I think Councilwoman Sussman brings up an important conversation around this around our transit corridors. It\\'s not just Colfax, but it\\'s it\\'s many corridors within our city that that are affected by this from federal, colorable, a ton of corridors that we have in the city. And so I think it\\'s important that we look at it. I think it\\'s in a compromise of the compromise of the compromise. And it looks at just transit corridors, not the other part of this bill, which is outside of the transit corridor. So I\\'m in support of this. You know, this this council, the city has talked about the importance of affordable housing. And one of the things we did in the discussions, the nine months of discussions we had around this is talk about, you know, what is the actual cost of one parking spot and how does that actually affect housing prices? How does that affect the cost of overall development? And we know that it is higher costs. We know that any parking spot now on a on a lot to create, it is between 20 and $35,000. And so when we add this, we are adding costs to our residents for the particular services they\\'re looking for. So I will be supporting councilwoman assessments amendment moving forward.

Members of the public council. We had this discussion about the small lots conversation, 60 to 50 lots and trying to figure out a compromise on these. And we heard from several council members and folks in the public that there was just not enough time to consider these two competing bills put up put forward by me and our president, pro Tem Clark. And so what I am asking is that, one, we delay the first reading of this bill to March 20th, and we also extend the moratorium, and the moratorium will be voted on in a block its it\\'s council bill 277 until May 20th. And I wanted to give everyone May 26. I want to give everyone a new date calendar of which things will take place. So tonight we will be filing a 60 day moratorium extension February 27th, on Monday, March 20th. First reading will be of the small parking lot text amendment and that it will be the second reading for the 60 day moratorium extension because you\\'ll need 30 days there on April 17th. Second reading of the small lot parking text amendment will happen and that will also be the public hearing. And then May 26, the moratorium will expire. So that\\'s what I am proposing to members of Council to give us about 60 more days to have conversation. We will have this in committee, in the luti committee, unfortunately. Councilwoman Sussman and Councilman New will not be available, but I can chair that committee and we will have a longer discussion on small lots.

              " Document(page_content='\"Motion passes. Hey, thank you very much. Now we\\'re moving on to item 22. Communication from Vice Mayor Richardson recommendation to request City Council approval of the 2017 federal legislative agenda as recommended by the Federal Legislation Committee. There\\'s a motion and a second Vice Mayor. So just a few updates here we have. So we met in November on November 15th to review staff\\'s recommended recommended changes for the 2017 federal legislative agenda. The committee made some fairly substantive changes to the agenda last year when we were reorganized and consolidated some of the statements that may have been repetitive in years past. And because we made so many, so many changes in the last update, and as the new presidential administration gets up and running, the first large committee will be focused on protecting existing revenues that the city current receive currently receives from the federal government, such as the Housing Choice Voucher Program, commonly known as Section eight, CDBG, other HUD programs. We\\'re also going to take a look at workforce programs and supporting those as well. And our existing legislative agenda already empowers us to do that. The committee heard that, you know, the committee may have heard that there\\'s one particular area of the of the legislative agenda, legislative agenda that could use some additional language. That\\'s the area of violence prevention and services to stem the homeless crisis in L.A. County. And because of all of our work, our mayor, city council, city staff have done around violence prevention staff recommended that we add language in the public safety section to support federal legislation that would assist with the implementation of violence prevention programs and in the area of homeless prevention. Staff recommended that the City Council support the city, support federal assistance toward establishing substance use treatment facilities in the region. Language to support mental health services is already existing there. Our committee voted to receive a file. All of staff\\'s recommended and recommended changes and for those to the City Council for Adoption tonight. Since our meeting in November, a number of executive orders signed by the new president make it so that we need to update an existing statement in our in our agenda supporting the expansion of dockets. Read one that reads supporting federal legislation that maintains existing allowances for undocumented immigrants to who qualify for the DOCA program to remain in the United States, as well as being as well as any legislation that protects safety and well-being of all Californians by ensuring state and local race resources are not used to support deportations, collect information about individuals or religious beliefs or affiliations that ultimately hurt California\\'s economy. Specific to the DOCA program, we\\'re talking about immigrants who enter the U.S. before the 16th birthday and before June 27 are currently in high school or high school graduate honorably discharged in the military under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012, and have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor or other or three other misdemeanors otherwise pose a threat to national security. So these recommended changes come because there\\'s been, you know, since these executive orders, a number of bills that have come out. And we wanted to make sure that our language and our letter agenda is wide and comprehensive enough to support different bills, whether it\\'s, you know, Feinstein\\'s bill or other other people\\'s bills that go forward, it still maintains the intent to support the DOCA language. And so that is sort of a highlight on what we\\'re doing tonight on the failed agenda. Thanks. Thank you, Councilmember Yuri. Councilmember Gonzales. I\\'ll defer Gonzales first. Councilman Gonzales. Q I don\\'t know what\\'s going on, Mayor. I\\'m sorry. No. It\\'s it\\'s Election Day. I know. That\\'s okay. I just want to say thank you to Diana and to Vice Mayor Richardson. And now we have Councilmember Saranga that will be joining us at our next Fed. Federal legislation relation trip. And so I think vice mayor reiterated many of the new actions that we\\'ll be taking when we go to D.C. and also here on the dais when we\\'re discussing Long Beach initiatives. But the things that kind of pop out in my mind, the items, of course, are immigration issues related to DOCA and the new executive order, specifically with the ban on predominantly Muslim countries environmental protections, which I know we\\'ll have to really look a little bit more into, and then securing our major capital projects like many of the initiatives that we have citywide. I want to make sure that we\\'re securing those and that funding is going through us as we see fit. So thank you very much for your work and I look forward to working with you all again. Thank you. Councilmember Ringo. Thank you, Mayor. It\\'s going to be my first year on this committee and I\\'m looking forward to it. It\\'s going to be quite a challenging year. Obviously, we\\'ve had a change in in our presidency and a different focus. And so I\\'m looking forward to advocating for the city on behalf of a Long Beach. Thank you. Councilmember Pearce. Yeah, I just want to say, you know, I took the time to read through everything on the agenda and I just it made me really proud to be a part of this council and to look at everything from immigration to gun control, violence prevention, affordable housing. A lot of the things that we aspire to do that sometimes are challenging and tough. And I know that we can\\'t do it all, but I just really thank you for making sure that this is comprehensive and that we, despite what\\'s happening at the federal level, are continuing to advocate and protect those that live in our communities here. So thank you. Thank you. Any public comment on this saying please cast your votes. Councilman, your anger.

              " Document(page_content='\"All right. Pursuant to Council Bill 3.7 consideration of the Council, Bill 285 will be postponed for one week until Tuesday, March 28th. No formal motion or vote is required. Madam Secretary, can you now put up Council Bill 161 on a screen? Because from where you put Council Bill 161 on the floor. Yes, Mr. President, I move that council bill 161 be ordered published. All right. It has been moved and seconded. Council. Councilman Clark, is this. Is this one of your. Why are we doing the this other amendment before my. Yes. Council secretary. Mm hmm. The ghost. GROSS. Hmm. Oh, yes. Okay. Thank you. From CPD. The gross. GROSS floor area. Yes. Okay. So this is a technical amendment to the the small lot proposal that we\\'re bringing forward. And this this has no major concerns over it. But I want to read it and we can get comments from members of council on page two. Line 16 strike the gross gross floor area of colon on page two. Line 18, strike two. The gross floor. Area of and and replace with all colon on page two lines 2021 strike the gross floor area of and replace with the uses in house in an on page two line 25 strike the gross floor area of and replace with all and on page four line four strike the gross floor area of and replace with all. It has been moved by me. Second, about Councilman Herndon. You know what? I\\'m going to call up a representative from CPD, Jeff Hart, to explain this amendment that we needed to get it done for the gross floor area on these small lot plants. Yes. So Jeff Hurt with CPD. So this is an amendment. It\\'s more of a technical clarification. The purpose of the amendment is that the original ordinance was drafted specifically relating to gross floor area of buildings per as it relates to the minimum parking requirements. And we had an issue raised from our staff, which is that some of the parking requirements are not linked to gross floor area other based on number of dwelling units. So it\\'s just more of a clarification where we were concerned that there might be sort of a loophole where if it was an exclusively residential project, then there would be kind of an omission with the text amendment that says it\\'s based on gross floor area, whereas it\\'s based on number of dwelling units. So it\\'s the the the quick answer is it\\'s a technical fix that doesn\\'t change any of the substance of the amendment. It just makes it more clear. Excellent. And in comes questions by members of council. All right, Madam Secretary. Councilman Espinosa. Said. Actually, you\\'ve confused me more by the answer on the confusion and dwelling units, and I apologize for not having the full text in front of me and let me put up here. So give me that explanation one more time. So if you look at the ordinance. Let\\'s see if you look at Section two to the A3 where it says exemption allowed. All of the language says that. So depending on where the exemption applies, it says the gross floor area of all uses housed in those floors. And so we have struck the language that says the gross floor area and just says all uses housed in those floors, which has the same effect. But by excluding those floor area, it sort of eliminates that potential loophole where when parking is not calculated based on gross floor area and by number of units. It\\'s a very it would be a very strict interpretation, but it could happen. So we wanted to make sure we close the loophole before it was exposed, I guess, as well. All right. Thanks for the slow reading. I appreciate. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Councilman. All right. As we move in second, Madam Secretary, roll call. Clark i. Espinosa. I Gilmore, i. Herndon, i. Cashman Can each. Lopez Hi, new. Sussman I black. I Mr. President. I. Please close the voting. Announce the results. 11 eyes. Okay. 11 eyes. This technical amendment has been passed, but we\\'re hearing that our attorneys believe we have the wrong information. Is that true? That we read the wrong information into the. Adam Hernandez. Adam Hernandez, Sun City attorney. One of the amendments you made, the last one said on. Page four. Line four, strike the gross. Floor area of and replace with all that should have been on page. Line three, line three, page four. Line four does not contain that language. Okay. So in the future, Adam, when you hear that, if you could pop up a little sooner so we don\\'t vote on it, it would be helpful. Madam Secretary, what would you like us to do? Would you and the correction just be made in the record? Mr. President? David Broadwell, assistant city attorney. I see people looking at me now. So I\\'d recommend you remove it with the correct the correct line number and page number and and voted again only to read the whole thing again. Just to have. Somebody move a corrected motion. Okay. So we\\'re going to move. I move that we have men council bill 17 161 especially on on page three line three strike gross gross floor area of and replace with all. It has been moved and seconded. Mr. BROUGH Well, is that okay, sir? Sounds good. Okay, great. Let\\'s move the second amount of secretary roll call clerk Hi. Espinosa. Hi, Gilmore. Herndon Cashman. I can eat Lopez. I knew Susman my black eye. Mr. President. I please close voting. Announce results. Espinosa. Espinosa. Hanging, firing. Is it frozen? There we go. Thanks. 11 eyes. Okay, 11 eyes. That technical amendment has passed. That\\'s why you pay lawyers to be in the room. All right, Councilman Clark, you can go ahead and read your amendment. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that health bill 161 be amended in the following particulars on page one after line 15, add the following. Whereas the City Council recognizes that a comprehensive citywide program is desired to manage demand for vehicle parking and to further citywide objectives to promote the use of multiple modes of transportation. And. Whereas, the Department of Public Works, the Department of Community Planning and Development, City Council and other agencies have expressed a commitment to pursue a comprehensive citywide program with the purposes of managing demand for vehicle parking and reducing vehicle trip generation. It has been moved in second. It comes from a member of council. Councilman Clark. Thank you, Mr. President. This amendment is in the preamble language. It doesn\\'t do a lot, actually, legislatively, but kind of captures the intent that we\\'ve been talking about at all of these meetings that I think is widely shared by council, that we are kind of having a big conversation in a little box. And really what we need to be working towards is a smarter ordinance, a transportation demand management ordinance. This kind of captures that in here to allow us to express that intent and continue pushing and working with staff across agencies to get that work done because it\\'s going to take something great. And as someone proposing Council Bill 161 I\\'ve been working on for the last nine months, I would say that this is the area most of us on city council agree on, that this is the direction we want to go in. Right now we are talking about probably an 18 month fix with this bill. But the hope and the overall transformation that we\\'re looking for is a transportation demand management system that many cities have has instituted, and the last one being San Francisco. We think this is the right thing to do. And I\\'m just so excited because Councilman Clark is going to be leading this two year effort with CPD in public works. And so this is something that I\\'m really supportive of. Councilman, Councilwoman, can each. Oh, thank you, Mr. President. Actually, I think you may have answered my question since this this stated that these departments have committed I just wanted to clarify that they were in the room, that that was accurate and that indeed, there is a commitment to establish a policy. And if there\\'s not, then I would ask them to come forward and clarify, because I would like to know that before I put it into the preamble. Thank you. Yes. And I think folks from CPD are they\\'re happy to come up here. But we\\'ve had many discussions with Brad Buchanan, Jose Cornejo, the current director of public works around this. And Councilman Clark, I know you want to jump in as well, who have stated their intent to move forward with this ordinance. Yeah. And anybody who wants to come up, feel free. But there is an RFP that\\'s going out on the street soon to start that process, engage with a consultant to look at the beginning steps of that. So I think it\\'s already starting and in motion this is reaffirming the. Yep. Thank you. Good evening. Sarah Showalter from CPD and the citywide planning supervisor. I just wanted to clarify, we we have been working really close to public works, very committed. But the RFP that\\'s being discussed that\\'s going on streets would be focusing on two D areas and downtown. And so we just wanted to emphasize, depending on resources and what this looks like, we don\\'t know exactly what the program\\'s going to be. And it is going to be a huge resource conversation, especially because the only way these programs work is if you can effectively administer them over time. So looking at our peer cities that have these, as the council president mentioned, there\\'s a lot of them that do. They have staff that are making sure that developments that have committed to do these TDM strategies are doing them, you know, years and decades into the future. So there\\'s a lot of different pieces we have to figure out, but we\\'re definitely committed to the concept and continuing the conversation for sure. Thank you, Sarah, for for bringing that up. And I think it\\'s important that this body who approves the budget every year, think about that as part of giving resources towards that. Councilwoman Sussman. Thank you, Mr. President. I think that it did happen. I wanted to let people know that what we are talking about is transportation, demand management. A lot of people know it as TDM. And while the preamble doesn\\'t doesn\\'t say that specifically, that is what it\\'s about for those who who are familiar with that language train. And glad to see this. Thank you very much, Councilman. Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman, Councilman Espinosa, I see you in there. I apologize. I\\'m sorry. I was like, keep fun in there yet get kicked out. Maybe somebody is working the monitor behind the screens. You know, I lost my train of thought, actually. I want to thank Councilman Clark for making for taking this on and making it a point, because I well, I\\'m sure this study would have been financed or funded. I think his leadership has moved it forward or higher on the queue, but is absolutely critical that we get these two independent agencies working together on this and talking about CPD and public works because there\\'s a huge gap here where our city, our zoning and what we allow in this form based, context based zoning and what goes on in our right of ways serving those properties or they are not speaking to one another in a in a way that is that works uniformly. What I mean by that is that there is a plan, review process and for a lot of for probably 95% of the cases in Denver, that\\'s going to be perfectly fine . But as you\\'re finding in the TOD and in downtown and there are other areas, so I wish you\\'d be open to having counsel sort of inform where we have this sort of disconnect between conditions on the street and the zoning that is that is being put in place. We can also then sort of inform these other areas that are critically important that need additional scrutiny. And what I mean by this is if we take where one bit of disconnect is, and I hope your study covers this is let\\'s take the 1600 Humboldt example that has already been part of this whole small lot exemption process is our current process would allow that. I mean, it is they can build it tomorrow. It\\'s a use by right situation and permits already been approved. And that\\'ll be 100% residential construction on two parts to 6250 lots, 108 units. And that would not be subject to the residential permit process. Why? Because we don\\'t pit residents versus residents. When we do that impact. But as far as zoning is concerned, completely immune or agnostic to what that uses in a mixed use zone district. That could be 100% commercial, 100% retail, or 100% residential. And the difference is, is in the case of the 100% commercial redevelopment, in the same exact parcel, the same exact square footage, public works would do a residential parking permit process, the IRP process, and whereby they both would have impact on the right of way. Somehow we need to get public works and CPD sort of using the same sort of logic. And I don\\'t mean it in that I don\\'t want public works to to not start looking at any of these things the way we\\'ve done it. CPD and say I actually want CPD to two. Well. I almost lost my train of thought. Well, the point being that they\\'re both a structure of that size, regardless of what its uses, will have impact on the public right away. The comments that that Councilman Clark keeps expounding upon. And so we need to have a better way of addressing I mean, looking at the situation, being proactive in the process and responding to it during the during the review process proactively. I think one way we can do that and I\\'m talking about these other areas that don\\'t necessarily fall in the Todd\\'s is we already have this process of the 5 a.m. sort of surveys that public works where they\\'re going around at 5 a.m. and looking at the right of way utilization and it\\'s over 75%. It\\'s a heavily impacted area, whatnot. Those are areas where, you know, there\\'s a lot of on street residential parking and so why not? Compel in certain set such scenarios, compel that survey to process to be done. And if a certain level of congestion is already found in the right of way, why not then use that as one of the things that informs the tier, the team process, so that you\\'re you\\'re compelling. A developer who wants to get to these minimum parking requirements to deliver on actual alternative means of transit is a part of getting there. And so my whole point is, is that I am encouraging this language because we need a tool. We\\'ve needed a tool for the last six years. And if it takes two years, so be it. But we need a tool to be able to look at these things, these situations on the ground. The conditions that are zoning has set up so that we\\'re actually working proactively with public works and compelling developers to address these transit needs for these on street parking needs, these right away needs and in the public realm. Thanks. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Clark. Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to jump in on the beginning of where Councilman Espinosa started and offer my also my thanks to you, Mr. President, for leading this effort. Leading this conversation, I think we\\'ve had such great conversations. And as we as we face the intense growth that we\\'re having and, you know, I know we get a bill up here and start talking amendments, but really, I feel like, you know, the council as a whole has come from the very from the very same place, the same place of caring about this community. And sometimes, you know, in the details, we get disagreement. But you\\'ve just had such an open door policy to me as I\\'ve explored this in my possible amendments. And I don\\'t think we would be having this conversation or the team conversation at all had you not taken this on. So I just want to say thank you before we got too far into this thing. Thank you, Ms.. Clarke. Councilman Neal. Sarah, I just had a couple more questions, please. Just for the public. We hear a lot about the Denver ride and the transportation strategic planning going on there. How does that relate to the tedium? Could you explain that? Sure. I think it\\'s a great question. So particularly for Blueprint Denver, which is the land use transportation plan that\\'s part of Denver. Right. That is the document that sets the policy for everything related to our land use regulations and the connection to transportation, which is really a lot of what this is about. And I think there\\'s a great opportunity through that process to explore some good policy guidance on some of these tough issues to talk about, you know, how much we want to try and accommodate off street parking needs versus allowing flexibility in the market to set that. You know, there\\'s there\\'s a lot of different opinions out there on this topic. So Blueprint Denver in particular is part of Denver. Right. Is a great way to plug in and start shaping, giving us some better policy direction on these topics. Right. And I just miss the team program that we\\'re proposing. It is funded. Right. No. My understanding is that they\\'re right now Public Works has actually been taking the lead on this. So I am. This is why I\\'m hearing second hand. We were looking at potentially under our toady manager within CPD, sharing the costs with public works. And public works is still trying to identify in this calendar year, this budget year, where they would be able to find money. So they\\'re working on an RFP, trying to get it out, but trying to identify the money now. The last I heard, they were still trying to find that. Half. The agency was committing to provide the other 50%, and that would just be for phase one. I understand correctly, which would be a first study. So it would help identify additional resources we might need. Like I mentioned, like how do you establish the program and make sure you have enough resources to have it be successful administered over time? So I would not say at this point that we have all the resources we need. Then what about an estimated timetable to complete the project? Yeah, that\\'s a great question. I think you could easily spend a couple of years doing a project like this. Thank you. Yeah. Good questions. Councilman, new councilman Espinosa. See you back up. Yeah, I\\'m just doing the math here. Tonight\\'s agenda. Over $12 million worth of appropriations and the $50,000 we need to do this study. I\\'m asking the mayor\\'s office. You\\'re here. Find the money. I mean, this is 50 million. $50,000 is nothing in our budget. If you can\\'t move forward on TDM, you\\'re showing that you\\'re not committed to doing smart, responsible transit and compel developers to be part of the solution and not part of the problem, not just part of the problem. So thanks. Thank you. Councilman Clark, I. Just wanted to jump in and I had some conversations just this morning, and I believe that those dollars have been identified. So I think we\\'re you know, we\\'ve got a long road to go. And I think we\\'re going to have to prioritize this as council as we go through the budget season. But I do think and I want to thank staff for, you know, reacting to this process, too, and on a short string coming up with moneys to get this thing started. And for council again, we approved the budget and we\\'re memorializing this, which is an indicator in support of how we can, you know, set money aside in this upcoming budget. And so I hope that we will remember this conversation. Councilman Clark, I trusted you\\'re going to make sure that we remember this conversation in September to make sure it\\'s included in the 2017 budget. Madam Secretary, roll call. Clark. All right. Espinosa. Gilmore. Herndon. Cashman. Kinney. Lopez. All right. New Sussman. Black. Mr. President. I was voting. And as a result. Your vote is. I\\'m an I. Sorry. 11 Eyes. 11 eyes. The preamble language including TDM, passes into the amendment. Okay into the bill as 161 councilman clerk your next amendment. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that council bill 161 be amended in the following particulars on page two, lines 17 insert the phrase including any modifications, alterations and expansions after the word building on page to strike the existing language on lines 18 through 22 and replace with the following. Any building located on a small zone lot that is voluntarily demolished shall not be considered an existing building. Voluntary. Voluntary demolish shall have the same meaning as the term demolition. Voluntary defined in Article 13, on page two, line 23. Other words new buildings on before the word small zone lots located within proximity to transit service. On page two line 28, replace the word shall with May on page three, line two other words new buildings on before the words all other small zones on page three, line five replace the word shall with May, and on page six after line eight, add the following. Section five. Section 12 .4.2.2 of the Denver Zoning Code dealing with the applicability of zoning permit review with informational notices amended by the addition of a new subsection D that reads as follows The construction of any new building on a small zone lot that includes a request for parking an exemption in accordance with section ten .4.5.1.8. All right. It has been moved and seconded. Hasn\\'t been seconded yet. I have a second. Okay. It has moved second to now. Councilman, catch. Councilman Clark. Thank you, Mr. President. This amendment requires that a zoning permit with informational notice for all new buildings on preexisting small zoned lots. That request to use the small loft parking exemption enables all expansions to existing buildings to receive the full parking exemption and clarifies at what point an existing building is considered a new building for the purpose of applying the small parking exemption. That is voluntary demolition. We talked a lot in committee about the difference between new construction and this rise in micro apartment construction and also trying to get the levers as as right as we can to not incentivize the demolition of existing structures. And so I think that part of this is that commitment to try not to incentivize demolition of existing structures unduly. And also adding the zip notification was something that a lot of the neighborhood groups had come and asked, said, hey, if this is going to happen, the potential impacts for us on the street of, you know, 108 units with zero parking are considerable. Could we have notification that gives us time to sit down with a developer and talk about what\\'s your plan to mitigate for those parking? How is this going to work? And while it doesn\\'t give a lot of control to the neighborhoods, it does allow that space and time for a conversation to be had between the neighbors and the developers and for the neighborhood to know what\\'s coming so that they can decide if they want to have those conversations and engage in that with the property developers. So that\\'s this amendment. Happy to answer any questions anybody has that didn\\'t get answered in committee. Thank you, Mr. President. Great. Thank you. Councilman Clark, any. Any questions? Remember, as a council. You have a comment? Okay. Councilwoman come. Councilwoman Black. I. I am supporting this because I think it\\'s really important that neighbors are informed about what\\'s happening in their neighborhoods. The microphone. Two concerns. One that Councilman Clarke alluded to is that Xp-Pen doesn\\'t actually give the neighborhood any power over what is going to go there. It gives them information and an opportunity to provide input. And I\\'m just concerned that people might think that it gives them some kind of power over the project. So I think it\\'s very important that neighbors know that. My other concern is that our zoning administrator and her department could possibly be very overburdened. So it it is sort of an unfunded mandate and I feel for you. So just wanted to say that I had those two concerns. Right. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Black. I have a couple of comments. So in our so folks understand, Councilman 161 came out of a working group that met five times that has professional leaders all over the city of Denver. And this topic came up and the group decided not to support it because it takes away from the predictability. And then it came before the planning board, and they decided not to support it because it also takes away from predictability. You know, in the planning board, the purview is pretty centered on the zoning code. And they do not have the the purview that we have on city council where we have to balance neighborhood interests, notification and things like that. The other thing that they don\\'t have is an understanding of what has happened with some of these current projects. And most of these larger projects are in Council District nine. And I\\'ve seen firsthand that when neighbors can talk with a developer, there are some changes that happen in the neighborhoods favor. And so a case in point on on the Humble Project 16th in Humboldt, after a long conversation, we had the developer supply a parking not structure, but a parking lot adjacent to the property, which will alleviate some of the concerns on 16th and Humboldt. So I am even though CBD cannot support this, I\\'m going to support this because there\\'s been so much consternation in neighborhoods and I do believe in the opportunity for people to sit down, talk and come up with reasonable solutions. So I\\'ll be supporting this as well. Any other comments? Questions for members of council? All right. Seeing none. Madam Secretary Rocha. Clerk. Hi. Espinosa. Hi. Gilmore. I. Herndon. Cashman. Carnage. Lopez. All right. New assessment. Black eye. Mr. President. I. Lebanese. All right. Thank you. 11 eyes. The zipping motion passes. Councilman Clark, want to offer another amendment or. Thank you, Mr. President. I did have another amendment that we\\'ve been discussing a lot in committee, and I will not be offering that tonight. I\\'d like to have that debate with the full council, if possible. And so I\\'m going to look at see if there\\'s a date where we can have that debate and continue working on that . That being said, I will be voting to move this forward as amended, but without my my my planned Third Amendment with hopes that I can at least have that conversation in front of the the full council before we get to the public. Okay. Thank you, Councilman Clark. All right, Councilwoman. Councilwoman, can each we have now amended this puppy. We need a motion to order published as amended. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that 161 be adopted as amended. No order publication. Ordered. Published as amended. Thank you. It has been moved in second it comments by members of council. I\\'ll just make a quick comment. We we again started working on this bill or this conversation. And in October, September, October. What makes this process great on city council is the input from your colleagues and the input from the public. And I think the amendments that Councilmember Clark and others who\\'ve worked with him has made this bill better and more palpable for for folks in the community, even though we\\'re talking about it. And I want to make sure we\\'re talking about a very small percentage of lots in the city of Denver. I want to keep saying that, but I think this makes it a little bit more palpable. And so thank you, Councilman Clark. It\\'s been great to work with you. I know you still got another amendment coming up at some point, but these ones I can support, it\\'s been moved in second it to be order published as amended . Madam Secretary, Raquel Clark I.

Will you please put council bill 161 on the floor. I move that council bill 161 be ordered published. All right. It has been moved. And second, if I move the council bill 161 be held in committee and brought back to the floor council on Monday, February 27th. And I want to give a couple reasons for this and having this conversation with many council members. In talking to Councilman Clark, we\\'re hearing a lot of folks need some time to really review some of these amendments, but more importantly, the public needs some time to review. So here is is my thought in this is that we would postpone this bill for one week. And on Thursday, I would file an extension of the moratorium for 60 days. One of the reasons we wanted to file an extension again is for more public commentary on the amendments that is being put forward by Councilman Clark and Councilman Espinosa. And others have said, you know, there\\'s folks in our district who has not who have not had a chance to really go through this particular proposal and see how it affects them. And so we\\'re going to do that as well during that time. And so we thought this would be appropriate, obviously, just to let the general public know we set this moratorium, I believe was in August for nine months and March 27th, 31st. March 31st is the date that the moratorium will be up. And so we\\'re running against the clock here and folks aren\\'t getting the time that they need to fully understand how the moratorium affects them. And so we thought it important to give a little bit more time and to be very clear that we intend to lift the moratorium and have a conversation going forward on what the proposal will be and vote on council. Councilman Clark. Yeah, I just wanted to thank you, Mr. President, for bringing this word. I think more time will add to the great dialog and debate that we\\'ve been having in committee. And I just really appreciate you putting this on the floor. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Similarly, I\\'d like to express my appreciation and the prudent sort of amount of time. I think that\\'s that that\\'s more than enough to sort of get the adequate input from District one constituents. So I truly appreciate it and thanks, Council. Councilwoman Canete. Thank you, Mr. President. I will vote to support the one week delay. I guess I had one question. I do not serve on Ludy. I\\'m doing my best to stay up when I can attend and to read materials. But one item that I did ask for from some of the zoning staff and I see we have a couple of folks, but I\\'m not quite sure who the staffer is for this. Particular proposal that Jeff heard is an audience. Thank you. Mr. Hurd, if you could, please, I would love to see an analysis of how many of the parcels are in commercial areas. So much of our debate has focused on residential, but some of these lots are in areas that are either, you know, solely commercial or primarily commercial. And so I just would be very helped if you could share that information prior to, you know, when we\\'re it sounds like with a 60 day delay will will be a ways out from debating it, but that\\'s some information that would be helpful to me. Thank you. And Jeff, I think we have a lot of that information in the percentages that my proposal or our proposal would affect some of these lots. And so we\\'ll get that right over to you. Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Since we\\'re. Making suggestions. I would like to hear from historic Denver, and I\\'d also like to hear from some affordable housing advocates and how they think this might impact that discussion one way or another. Great. And we have two representatives. We had an Annie Levinsky, which was on our stakeholder committee, and also had a affordable housing representative as well. And so we can get both of those folks to testify as well at the hearing so that you can hear their analysis of what they think about this. Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. While we\\'re giving out, thanks for the process and I echo what\\'s been said before, I just want to add my thanks to the neighborhood representatives who have really, I think, been the moving force from the beginning about bringing this to council attention and for just pushing for council to do a thorough job on assessing all opportunities to get these lots developed with a minimal as minimal an impact as possible on surrounding neighborhoods. We have some representatives over here and thank you all for coming tonight and for the work you\\'ve been doing all along. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Councilman. Councilman Cashman. I\\'ll just make one more comment in in conjunction with Councilwoman Sussman in the next month, we can kind of talk about what needs to have other further conversations in committee, if you\\'d be open to that simply. Okay. And on next Monday, we\\'ll give you all a full schedule of how we intend to proceed, as well as the moratorium bill. That will be a moratorium extension that will be filed on Thursday, and then we\\'ll be talking about it on Monday.

You had mentioned that an and it\\'s been a little bit so I\\'m dusting the cobwebs off. I might ask you a couple of questions. You\\'re on the board of the R.A. in question, correct? The. Actually, I was. And I\\'m sorry to say that I. Was I resigned in the last month. From the. Board. I was located for the last four years. Three years. Well, that\\'s another question. So you were on the. You were on the board was. Yes, I. Was. And the last time we we talked about this in this room. You had mentioned that there was a vote of the board, and it was three members of the board voting in favor and two abstentions. Is that right? Correct. Did you vote in favor of the. No. So you were one of the abstentions? Correct. Can you talk a little bit about how that vote came about and why you abstained? Well, it I found out about it. And it was 15 minutes late from the phone call. I got a phone call and we said, we\\'re voting in 15 or we were voting. And I went to my voicemail and I didn\\'t I didn\\'t get it. So I was out of it. I wasn\\'t part of the vote. Does the neighborhood organization have any bylaws that require there to be a minimum time of notice? We have no. It\\'s an R.A.. We started it four years ago, and there are no official bylaws at this point. You know, as of that day, we had adopted, you know, processes. We followed what rules were published. Whenever you whenever you read the the Denver Public Code or whatever. Kiawah I think it\\'s a state. Law to do it. So, you know, we tried to follow normal processes, said majorities and in in that unique. But it was it was a board meeting it was it was a it was not a R.A. meeting. I mean, it was not a vote. The neighborhood has never we haven\\'t had a neighborhood meeting on this for the last two months. Okay. Okay. Fair. Fair enough. So you\\'re no longer on the board? Why? Why are you no longer on the board? Well, I was I was very uncomfortable with having the board make the decision for the neighborhood by themselves with on their own personal with their own personal opinions, reluctant. The board was not was not willing to enable us to to get more feedback from the neighborhood. They push back on on getting sending letters out and getting writing up and getting all the votes. They were reluctant to have another meeting at the general meeting before they made a decision where if they made a decision today, I heard that there was a decision, but I wasn\\'t going to do that just as a board myself . I just was unable to do. Did you feel to do that attenuated? Did you feel like you could not express your I mean, it\\'s this is what I\\'m and what I\\'m hearing. You didn\\'t you could not express. I or my opinions, but they were voted down in in the board. And and I just I wasn\\'t going to be part of that. I was just not not willing to to I don\\'t think that\\'s a correct way for the board of board of to operate in an R.A.. Okay. I think we should be listening to the neighborhood. Thank you, sir. May I speak with someone who\\'s currently on the board? Is there someone whose would either of you come forward? And will you state your name for the record and for those watching on television? Of course. My name is Mark Wallwork. I\\'m a vice president of the board of the I.R.A. and I am on the board. I\\'ve lived in the neighborhood for 16 years. Okay. Mr. Holick, who who entered said there was a development agreement that that we received just before this meeting here on the board. Did you vote to enter into this development agreement? We did. Okay. And did you. Can you tell. Can you tell me a little bit about the the process that you used to engage the neighbors, if that existed, to help the board come to this decision to enter into the agreement? Certainly, there were several neighborhood meetings, so we did have neighborhood meetings that were sponsored by the developer, and I believe I attended all of them are two of our other board members attended most of them, if not all of them. George may have made one or two. He made a couple. So we did attend those. All of us were very skeptical and asked hard questions to the developer. We also were very the board members, Elaina, Aiden and I, we listened very closely to the residents who were voicing their opinions in those meetings. So there were 3 to 4 of those meetings, and we were listening and jumping in and answering questions where we could where we felt like we could answer for the neighborhood, those of us who had been engaged. Okay. There has. And were you here when we discussed this last? I was not here last month. That\\'s fine. Were you nerdy enough to watch it? I was nerdy enough to watch. Okay, well, fair enough. So one of the things that we talked about last the last meeting was that there was a vote of the members of the R.A. and though that vote seemed to be pretty heavily against this vacation request. But then the board voted in favor of the vacation request. Can you provide some context as to I mean, did did you take a different vote or. Sure. Would you mind repeating the two pieces there? The first one was. The members of the organization, as in the the R.A. members as opposed. To the board? Yep. Yes. Okay. Sure. Just a little bit of clarification. George had asked the board how we felt about the vacation of the right of way. Up until that point, we. Had tried to be. We had tried to send to the board, which was not centered at the time, and we were maintaining a very neutral stance. Aiden, Elena and I. Okay. George wanted to know how we felt. So we met. We tried to incorporate George. Schedules did not work out. We were able to incorporate George. And for clarification, there were not two abstentions. There was only one abstention. And that was George\\'s. So we had no no votes. We had three yes votes, and we had one abstention. At that time, I made it clear, and I believe that Aiden and Elaina were in agreement that we had no inclination of publicizing that. That was simply a moment for George as president to get an idea of where we stood as board members. I made it very, very clear that we had no intention of publishing that, vocalizing that in any way. George did that on his own last month, which we\\'re fine with. But I just wanted to clarify that. Okay. And what about the the the vote of the members, not necessarily the vote of the board. So that as I understand it, I think, Mr. Pazienza and you are both aligned that that the vote was three yes and no. No one against. Correct. But can you reconcile that vote of the board versus what we\\'ve seen a month ago was a pretty heavily against vote of the members of the R.A.. Sure. I would love to speak to that. It\\'s a great point. I think that what you\\'re referring to is metrics that George presented. It was not a a vote of the neighborhood, so there was not a coming together of the neighborhood to raise our hands. Hey, do we support the right of way, vacation or not? George had compiled information using multiple sources, and I believe that\\'s what you\\'re referring to, where you have a number of people who say they are against the right of way vacation, meaning a number of residents who are against the right of way vacation. And then comparing that to this sort of private vote to get a feel of how we as board members felt and we were all obviously in support. Okay. I hope that\\'s helpful. It is. Okay. Thank you, I. And do you do you know who currently? I don\\'t know if you\\'re the right person to answer this or not. Do you know who currently owns 2099 Chestnut? The 2099 the the actual right of way or the the. The the if we were to vacate this that well, I guess the city owns the 2099 but the adjacent property. Right so it\\'s my understanding there is only one adjacent property owner and her name is Lorraine. I forget her last name. I do not know her personally. I almost met her once. Fair enough. Thank you. And. And I have no further questions for now. Thank Government Councilman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. My questions are for the city attorney in the document. Oh, and I see he has stepped up. Okay. So you tell us your name. MARTIN Play with city attorney\\'s office municipal operations. So, Martin, have you seen the developer agreement that was shared with all of us today? No, I have not. And based on my understanding, developer agreement is a term of art. In the city. Attorney\\'s office. A development agreement would be something that the city may enter into. As I understand it, this is a good neighbor agreement and this city does not enter into good neighbor agreements. So then there would be no reason for me to say it. So I want to read you one of the statements that\\'s in here. It is. On Page four and its effective date and binding nature of the agreement. It says the agreement and each of the provisions hereof shall become effective upon its execution and shall be binding on all the parties. And assigned to this agreement shall be assigned by any owner of the chestnut property and the vacated right away to a subsequent buyer of the Chestnut property and the vacated right away. And such buyer shall assume the obligations of the MDI herein. So this is the MDI is listed here as the name of the company who\\'s doing business. Under the title, you know, the developer for the project. So my question to you is hearing that statement, is it your understanding that this would then apply to anybody else if this. Property owner decided to sell the land to someone else. I can\\'t answer that definitively without looking at the agreement. I\\'m sorry. Possibly, but I can\\'t say with certainty whether that. Okay. I would have to review the entire agreement. Okay. I reviewed it with Troy earlier, so I\\'m going to ask Troy. If you would. This is Troy Broughton from the city attorney\\'s office. I agree with Martin without reviewing the entire document. I mean, the language that you read does seem to mean that it would apply to future owners as long as that last clause and that last sentence in the provision doesn\\'t apply. So, yes. Okay. And the last clause in the provision is, if MDI does not acquire both the chestnut property and the vacated right away and the city does not approve both the ordinance and the application, this agreement shall be no and void, and none of the parties shall have any rights or obligations hereunder. So that\\'s the part you were referring to. Right. Okay. Last question is actually, this is not for the city attorney. It\\'s for someone who is part of the R.A. currently. Can you. What have you come up? Tell us your name. Hi. My name\\'s Elena. Baroni. Elena is the R.A.. Registered as a501c3. I would have. To defer to my board member. Yes, we are. I don\\'t know. You got to come. To the right sort of. Things. Comment on the record. We\\'re in. Process. Pardon me, Marc Horlick. I don\\'t remember all the numbers that are at the end. We are registered. We are incorporated as a nonprofit. But no, no, the answer is no to your question. So you have you applied for your final 23, then? We have not. Okay. You\\'re incorporated, but you\\'re not a nonprofit as of 501 C3. That\\'s correct. Okay. Okay. So I was just trying to to understand if it\\'s considered a legal entity in order for, you know, there to be this formal agreement that sort of applies to the whole neighborhood. So that\\'s your interpretation based on the negotiations that you all did. With our understanding that is that we are indeed incorporated as a nonprofit. With the secretary of state. The secretary of state? Yes, ma\\'am. Got it. Okay. Those are the only questions I have for now. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Torres. Thank you so much. Actually, folks, would you mind coming back? I just have a couple other questions just on the R.A. piece, because and thank you for being here. My question is largely around the statistical neighborhood that the R.A. covers, because the property in question here is in the Five Points neighborhood and not Union Park. I\\'m sorry, Union Station North. Can you describe for me the boundaries of your R.A.? I might be able to count on this. It is correct. We are part of five points, and I forget what the terminology is for that particular designation. A statistical you. We are within five points. As an R.A. called Union Station North. But you do have boundaries. What are they? Do you know? I do. Basically railroad tracks before the loss or the other side of the flour mill lofts. So we\\'re on on this side of that, we have 20th Street and we also have Dell Gainey. However, the K.C. apartments are not included and are somehow they got scooped out before or after they were built. Okay. The thank you so much. My second question, thank you all is actually for public works. And you might want to just get comfortable in this front. We have a lot of people in the line, so you might just stay up here. Good evening, Jason of Denver Public Works. Hi, Jason. Just a couple clarifying questions because there were a number of justifications that were sent to us in letters of support or opposition that I just want to make sure I understand and that those requesters understand the parcel that is designated as the right away right now that the city owns and operates. At any point, can anything be built on it? Currently, under our guidelines, no. Currently, right now it is considered right away. We always do enhancements to different roadways throughout the city like green infrastructure and those type of things. Not as requested in the past hearing, which was a pocket park or something of that matter. But we do stuff like that. But currently, no, as it stands, we can\\'t actually build something on this roadway based off of law that says this is right away. It needs to be have a utility or a mobility use to it in order for us to not vacate or okay. One of the equivalent or what was being proposed is an equivalent circumstance was mentioned a plat plat street area, kind of a right of way in between two major building sections. How is that different from what we\\'re talking about today? Right. So that\\'s a plaza that is between the Plaza Street and the pedestrian bridge that\\'s across the South Platte River. And what that is, is an actual area that we put in green infrastructure whose we, the city or other people, we work with it now. We didn\\'t actually put in there\\'s a proposed green infrastructure that is going to go in there. And the difference between this area and the land that we\\'re talking about tonight, which is 2099, Chestnut Place, is the developer who who built right there on the plaza and is asking to put a $1.7 million investment to put green infrastructure . We work with developers throughout the city to try to enhance green infrastructure. This is an actual park and it won\\'t prohibit the utility or the walkway that the plaza is meant to do to get people from Platt Street to the pedestrian bridge. So in those scenarios we do it all the time. We have an entire green infrastructure group with the city and county that works with developers to try to enhance these sidewalks, to have more trees and plants and those type of things throughout the city. And in that circumstance, it wasn\\'t a city owned parcel. It was already owned by one of the adjacent property owners. No, no, it\\'s right away. And this is just like anywhere else where we put planters or we put trees or anything else. And right away it still belongs to the city. But we work with developers as they develop our sidewalks and those type of things to put in more green infrastructure, which is just an enhancement that we all enjoy in these scenarios versus in this scenario. We would have to do the investment because there isn\\'t somebody who\\'s developing there to put in something. So we wouldn\\'t put in an investment in something that could be vacated because the only guidelines we have is public works. See that that there is a two requirements, mobility and utility requirement. If those two things are not met, then we are to go through the vacating process. There is no carve out in state law that says if we put in $1,000,000 investment into a pocket park, that we get to deny a vacation based off of that. So we wouldn\\'t put an investment into an area right away like that and then possibly lose it to a vacation. Okay. Thank you, Jason. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilwoman Calvin Black. Your speaker\\'s not on. You might also get comfortable up here in the front row. Yeah. I\\'m very interested in the legal aspects of this vacation. I wasn\\'t here for the previous hearing, but we vote on these every week. We vote when developers dedicate land to the city, and then we also vote on vacations. And it\\'s my understanding that there are more square feet of land that is dedicated to this city than we vacate. Is that correct? Historically, yes. We have far more dedications, and some of these dedications are quite big. We just had one two weeks ago, they went through there was roughly 20,000 square feet of dedication, which included streets, sidewalks and a lot of amenities that we agreed to. And historically, yes, the vacations are far less than the dedications we receive. This year alone, we\\'ve only had ten vacations go through city council where we are, you know, anywhere between 50 to 100 every year of dedications, depending on what\\'s going on in the city. So it\\'s state law that governs this. It governs the relationship between dedications and vacations, because state law essentially from public works view, sees it as we don\\'t want to make up. We don\\'t want to have to buy dedications because it enhances mobility throughout the city. It makes it where we can get around as as as citizens and be able to get to point A to point B. We also on the flip side, we want to pick a process that goes forward that allows us to vacate land and not. And then the city makes a profit off that. A lot of land that we vacate was at some point dedicated to us. So to make a profit off it would be unfair. So the state tries to guide us to make sure that we don\\'t require dedications and then later down the line make a profit off it when it\\'s requested to be vacated. So it seems like we\\'re sort of trying to balance a common good, I guess. Absolutely so. I know in a lot of new developments the developer is is dedicating land that then are big five foot sidewalk separated with the tree line that are adding to our mobility. Right. So in this particular one, I don\\'t know if you\\'ve seen the development agreement. Of course we got it at 437, but it says that it it will complete 4500 square feet of usable open space with benches, trees, etc.. New and larger sidewalks, new signage and signs will be designed with R.A. involvement and some other stuff. But so if they\\'re going to build new and larger sidewalks, then would they then dedicate that back to the city? I can only speak to what the requirement from the city would be in these would be that the if there is a build on this property, there will be dedication of of sidewalk to make it where people can get around. That\\'s just the relationship we have with development throughout the city to make sure that people are able to get to point A to point B and safely. So in this case, for this parcel and probably the other sides of it, ultimately there will be land dedicated back to the city. Where this sidewalk and in different parts of those. So it\\'s really unusual that we have this multiple hearings and we\\'ve never had them before. Since I\\'ve been on council and in previous vacations, I had talked to our city attorney and asked if this was something that could be used to negotiate with. And I was told no. So I\\'m I\\'m just I know I wasn\\'t here for the last hearing, but I\\'m a little perplexed that. That we\\'re having this hearing and wondering if, you know, if the city didn\\'t want to vacate it and the city wanted to widen the street, for example, using that land, would we have a hearing ? I guess I\\'m asking you two questions at the same time. But so the hearing on this vacation was a request from city council. So we went through this process. But when it comes to widening roads, we look at that because we look at mobility options that are not just happening now but happening future mobility options that could be in the area. So we we kind of based off our knowledge of what we think is going to happen with growth in the city and everything else. We take all that into consideration before we actually do the vacation. I get that there\\'s things that can change, development can slow down or increase rapidly based off economic things, but this is the best estimate we have. And based of this particular vacation, the city is comfortable with, vacating it with and still keeping our mobility goals. Okay. Thank you. And then I just have one question for the neighborhood or people. Sorry for. Us. Yeah. So I just sort of read what was in the agreement, just a few things. And is that your understanding of it? 4500 square feet of usable open space. And which page are you on? Well, it\\'s actually in there. In the exhibit. Yeah. So benches, trees, larger sidewalks, signage, lights, and then the design would be finalized with your involvement. I just wanted to clarify that. That is correct. Which exhibit page are you on? This should be in a one through four, maybe. It was just sort of the summary. Sure. That yes, basically that is our understanding. I was trying to reference that, but I guess I don\\'t need to. And that we would have input. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Councilman Herndon. He was present, I don\\'t think my colleagues, because they have asked a lot of the questions that I was going to. So I just have one. And I\\'d like to call Jim Johnson to the podium. And Jim, if you could just give your name and background so that. Oh, sure. Jim Johnson. I am an attorney representing the developer under the development agreement. And I spoke with you at the last about a month ago, at the last hearing. And so you helped draft this agreement? Indeed, I did. Okay. So you would be an expert that you could say, is this because we asked our city attorneys and they were not privy to the contract? I am sure you have since you\\'re a party of this. Is this a in your legal opinion, you could certainly be wrong. Do you believe this is a binding agreement between the developer and the registrant? I believe it is a binding agreement, and that was certainly our intent. And in part part of the reason that we we delayed the decision on this matter until this this time was so that the R.A. could go get incorporated and actually make themselves a legal entity so that they could contract and have some enforcement rights there. And both parties have agreed to this agreement. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Herndon, Councilman Sandoval. Thank you, Mr. President. So I have a question. The Sage George and the R.A. representatives, are there any other members in the audience who live in the in this boundary? Can you please stand up? Can you please come to the front? Can you all just please quickly state your name, whether you own or rent, and whether you\\'re for or against this? Ali This right of way. Stephen Barry I own and I\\'m against. And how long have you lived in the neighborhood? Two and a half years. Thank you. And Sophie Barry also owned with Stephen Barry and also object. Thank you. David Kleckner. I object. 12 year resident. Thank you. Oh, sorry. Owner. Resident. Thank you. Margaret Pazienza. I\\'m an owner and I object. And I\\'ve lived there since 2013. Thank you. I\\'m Kim White. I\\'m an owner for about 11 years, I think. And object. Thank you. So for the R.A., can I have a couple of questions for the vice acting vice president? Yes. So do you have the bylaws? We do now have bylaws, yes. When as as of our incorporation prior, we do. Form those bylaws. We used a template that we received from our attorney. He recommended them. And who\\'s paying for the attorney? I am. Okay. And how long have you lived in the neighborhood? And do you own or rent? I rent and I have been there for 16 years with my husband. Okay. And then do you have like a database or list served? Like so like the registered neighborhood organizations in northwest Denver have a listserv, right? And they send out the agendas and they send out their monthly notifications. So do you have something like that? We do have a global email. We have our own email address. George resigned nine days ago and we are trying to pick up those pieces. He was controlling those items. So we are just now new to getting a hold of those that email system. But yes, we have had that since we are since we became an R.A.. And in the past, have you had monthly meetings? Do you have monthly meetings or how do you function as an R.A.? Because a lot of our owners have monthly meetings and then they have agendas. And tell me your experience as the vice president. Sure. My experience with the R.A. is that we have maintained an annual meeting for the neighborhood. I think we followed that because that\\'s what was required by the or by the city and county as an R.A. And then we would add ad hoc, if we found an issue, would come up both for the neighborhood and for the board. That has always been the way we have run on an ad hoc system. We\\'ve never had anything more than an annual meeting. So we are. You were voting in these meetings. I feel that sometimes representatives vote on these. R.A. Did you ask, did you take a straw poll of the members of your R.A. or did you just vote based on how you felt like did you take like a majority rules type thing? Or was it just you and a couple other people voting because you represent these other people? Correct. So how did you come to the conclusion that you were voting in favor of it? Are you talking about the on this specific item? So on this specific item, how we how the board came to a vote on whether we support the vacation of the right of way or not was brought about by George Pazienza, our former president. He wanted to know where we stood, and so we did that. And did you ask your neighbors, you specifically have did you go around knocking doors and asking your neighbors how they felt about this? That\\'s a great question. I did not literally, obviously texting and running into folks in the hall. J.D. and I are very neighborly people and we know a lot of people, and we would see them at the developer meetings and we would say, Hey, how do you feel? We would hear folks get up and speak at the developer meetings, the ones that were coming along every week or so. And sometimes I would be surprised that someone would say one thing when I thought they meant another, so I would seek them out after the meeting and speak with them. I did that on multiple occasions. Okay. Thank you. Sure. I have a couple of questions. For public works. So in your statement just now, when you were answering, Councilman Black, you talked about parcels needed for mobility, correct? Correct. So this could this pass will be used for mobility in the future? In our assessment, no. So it can be used for any type of bike station like it is now. It can\\'t use be used for scooter parking. So absolutely. And there\\'s several places within the area that we have assessed. It could also use those there to move it. And I know there was an agreement with the current base B cycle and the developer to actually keep it on the property. But there\\'s other places that we identified that we can do and still meet. The needs of the of the neighborhood. Could be used or not. Yet it is currently it does currently have a B cycle station on it. So is public works working on a policy called transportation demand management? Yes. And within the transportation demand management, are you not going to require future development to have transportation demand management plans? Correct. So if you look at this map, I don\\'t know if you have one, but there\\'s a 813 bedroom apartment slated for construction and then a 13 story tower apartments slated for construction. Do you feel like these? I can\\'t remember all the triggers for transportation demand management, but I believe that these would trigger them, correct? I believe so. Under the current plan we are trying to put forward, remember, the plan is still being put forward. So depending on when this actual development takes place, whether it will be before we actually have this plan in place or not, the time which you\\'re talking about. Yes. So if the 813 bedroom construction went online and transportation demand management was also a policy, could they put some of their scooter parking there? Could they use part of that area because it\\'s right away to help ease the ingress and egress of this area. So in when it comes to Treme, just a little bit backwards is we don\\'t we won\\'t require somebody to have parking for scooters. Scooters is provided by a private sector who are working in relationship with us to use the right of away to make parking stations themselves. We wouldn\\'t lean on developers to have to provide parking for them, but TDM is mostly to give the tools to these developments to cut down the SUV, SUV, which is the single occupant vehicle being used by 50%. These tools are far greater than scooters or any of those type of things and we wouldn\\'t have those requirements in TDM. We are trying to figure out ways to get people to transit into and out of the single occupant vehicle, which could be scooters. But scooters as being a private sector mobility option would have to work on getting their own areas to put scooters. Okay. So when Councilman Terrace was talking about Klatch Street and you kept talking about we, how much money has public works invested in the $1.7 million by unico developer into that right of way to make it the green space it is like how much has public works invested? None. This is a private option that they requested and felt that the option of investing this $1.7 million was worthwhile. To be able to create green infrastructure in the plaza, which they can put tables out and chairs out for everybody in the community to enjoy. This is a this is the type of relationship we tried to build throughout the city on green. Infrastructure. And. To minimize our investment. In new started in public works. But just fancy me this question. Were you here when Unicode put in that way to vacate that area? Were you in your position? Okay. And then do you know how much the developer has paid in permits to get the $1.7 million invested? But the permit process that they\\'ve also had to pay. I do not know offhand, but I can definitely get you that information. Okay. And then I have one question for the lawyer who put together the proposal. Yes. Tim Johnson. Thank you, sir. Thank you for being here tonight. My pleasure. So I have a question for you. How besides saying that this that you all signed off on this development agreement or in other words, a good neighbor agreement saying you\\'re part of the the side your developer doesn\\'t follow through. How do. What recourse does the neighbors have to come and find you? Would they have to get a lawyer or would they come to the city or what? What recourse does the then neighborhood organization have to make sure that you follow through with the the agreement and and codify it like you have said? So that was one of the big concerns that the that the neighborhood organization had when we were talking about this agreement. And actually the first version of this agreement that we put forth had a much more, I would say, traditional arrangement where they would where they were the R.A. would have to get a lawyer and there would be there\\'s an arbitration process based on their comments, on the R.A. comments. We we very much streamline that process. And so now there is a there is a very quick process to get to an agreement. Essentially, the R.A. there\\'s there\\'s two different stages. So there\\'s during construction and then there\\'s after construction because there\\'s some obligations in here that the that they\\'re really actually three pre-development during construction and after construction and so. During pre-development and construction. There is contact information in here for somebody directly at the construction company that can that anybody can call this person and say, we have a problem, that you\\'re not adhering to the provisions of this agreement. There\\'s a 24 hour provision there, 24 hours to to resolve the issue. And if that\\'s not resolved in 24 hours, and there\\'s like I believe it\\'s a three day time frame for the R.A. to come to arbitration, put present whatever information they want. And actually, the developer is responsible for. Paying up. To a certain amount of the costs of the R.A. to do that. So there\\'s no lawyer\\'s required, and it\\'s intended to be a very quick process. So but the. So if they had to come to arbitration there, it would be on the owners of the registered neighborhood organization. That\\'s that\\'s correct. And so in in your experience. Registered neighborhood organizations, Jorge just resigned and now we have a new vice president. What happens if the vice president who\\'s signed the document isn\\'t here? Six, six, ten months during construction? 22 months. What happens then? Who carries this document forward? That\\'s the reason that it was critical that they be incorporated, that they are no be incorporated in sign off and become an entity and registered under Secretary of State, because then there\\'s ongoing requirements for that entity to have perpetual existence. And so whoever is in whoever\\'s managing that company, it would be like any other any other company out there, as opposed to just a registered neighborhood organization that didn\\'t that didn\\'t have independent kind of viability. So we\\'re making a registered neighborhood organization become incorporated, take legal action, and make sure that they\\'re following through when it\\'s all volunteer to follow through to make sure that your good developer agreement gets followed through on. Is that what I\\'m hearing. That that is? That\\'s one way to put it. But this arrangement is not unusual in Cherry Creek, Cherry Creek Neighborhood North Organization is the same way they\\'re incorporated there. 501c3 And they have the same kind of model and perpetual existence. And so it\\'s not it\\'s not kind of a new idea that we\\'re trying to do here. It\\'s something that\\'s that\\'s been replicated in other areas of the city. And way I would I guess I would caution you not to call it a good neighbor agreement. In my opinion, at least a good neighbor agreement is where there is some kind of aspirational element to it. And there\\'s an acknowledgment that there\\'s really not an entity there that can enforce the obligations. And then the ones I\\'ve been associated with are typically we\\'re going to respect certain construction hours. We\\'re not going to respect certain noise that maybe is above and beyond what the city would otherwise require. And this agreement, there\\'s an obligation that that the developer is going to process an application with the city that\\'s consistent with with things that that the developer that the that R.A. has requested, things like the open space in the and the improvements to the corner and step back requirements and brick veneer requirements, things like that that I\\'ve never seen in personally never seen in a good neighborhood agreement. There\\'s there\\'s there\\'s this is a beefier and much more, I would say more traditional kind of develop agreement, development agreement, not in the in the municipal sense. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. All right, councilmembers. We have a lot of people in the queue as people jump in back in the queue for a second time. And we certainly can debate this all night. We\\'ve kept this hearing open for a long time. I will just ask, if possible, please keep your questions concise and keep them to information that hasn\\'t been presented, things that will help you make your decision if you already have your decision made. Let\\'s get two comments so that we can get this one resolved once and for all. Tells me Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. So, sir, the attorney. And we had, I believe, two delays of this project, of this decision extending over several weeks. And I\\'m wondering why we got this agreement. Minutes before the meeting with no time to really consider it or evaluate it. I I\\'ll I can say as I apologize for the timing of that I can\\'t give you an answer to that. I don\\'t know. I was not part of actually getting the document signed up or any any of that. So I don\\'t know why you got it when you got it. I don\\'t know. Is there anyone. Here that can answer that question? Yes, sir. If you have an answer. Tabor Suite with Mortenson Development. The R.A. was actually incorporated on Thursday. Yes, the R.A. was in corporate on Thursday, so they couldn\\'t execute prior to that. We got the signed agreement on Friday morning and then candidly, we\\'re a very big company and signatures don\\'t come very quick. So we did our best. And I\\'m sorry that it was last minute, but it was just a more of a function of getting the right person. In the right room to execute on our side. I. Difficult the weeks that we set this back. My other question is for Troy. Thank you, Mr. Shrimp. When we\\'re addressing rezonings, we have specific criteria we\\'re legally obligated to assess by what. What are our obligations in this case? Well, I would defer to Martin, the city attorney, but in my mind, it\\'s it\\'s a legislative decision. It\\'s a it\\'s a vote. Yes or no. Sir. Martin played assistant city attorney, meaning ops choice. Correct. It\\'s a legislative decision. There are no criteria. There is a statutory criteria that government cannot vacate. Right of way, if it will leave a property landlocked. That is the only requirement and that\\'s not here. So really, with it being a legislative decision, it\\'s does city council feel that the city needs the right of way now or in the future? Right. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Gilmore. Thank you, Mr. President. One of the representatives from the. Reno Police. Force. So I got a little confused around. Well, could you clarify, are you an LLC that is registered with the secretary of the state, or are you a501 C3, which would have to go through the IRS, the secretary of state, and then the local municipality? We are not the second one. We are definitely not. You are not a51 C3 because that\\'s a nonprofit organization. So an an LLC. Correct, for profit. So which are you? So we when we incorporated, we were able to select nonprofit and we made that selection. It\\'s fairly streamlined online. So you registered. With the Secretary of State, correct? So you have not thus far then filled out the federal IRS. Councilwoman, can I have one C3? Sorry, I don\\'t want to interrupt. I just want to make sure it\\'s clear that you can be a nonprofit without being a501 C3 and registering through the IRS. There are mechanisms through the Secretary of State\\'s office to become a nonprofit without necessarily dealing with the IRS and those tax implications. So can you clarify if because this is new information to me, because. I founded and ran a. Nonprofit for 20 years and was fully compliant with all the federal and state and local regulations. So if you file with the Secretary of State\\'s office as a nonprofit, can you accept tax or not or. With. Charitable contributions? Right. So that\\'s where the tax implications come on when you are accepting charitable contributions and how those are taxed. But you can register to become a nonprofit without without any tax repercussions with the IRS. So are you going to operate and accept charitable donations? We have elected not to take any moneys, no clues, no contributions. Correct. Okay. So what the Mr. Johnson, I believe, said and to Councilwoman Sandoval\\'s questions, if there is a dispute or the developer in this developer agreement that I believe they wrote and crafted, if there\\'s an issue, you\\'re not going to have any funds to hire a lawyer to make sure that they are complying with what they wrote in the developer agreement. So how are you proposing that you\\'re going to legally represent the R.A. to the full. Extent of the law. We negotiated? I totally get what you\\'re saying. It was one of the first questions that I had. Basically, our hands would be tied. It was incorporated into and negotiated into the developer agreement as best as we were able to, to alleviate that, to make it so that we would not need to pay any moneys. But to answer your question, if it were to come to that, it would be difficult. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. And then, Mr. Johnson, I have a question for you on and that we did get this very late, but I\\'ve been trying to review it really quickly on page four of the agreement. Number six, it says that the attorneys fees or talks about attorney\\'s fees and says within five business days following the execution of this agreement, MDI will pay the Arnaud\\'s reasonable attorney\\'s fees in connection with negotiation and execution of this agreement, which the parties agree is $3,000. So. So you crafted this document. They\\'re going to sign it, but then you\\'re going to turn around and pay them $3,000, is that correct? Yes. And that\\'s really not unusual. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Cannick. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to just bring Jason Gallardo, Fleurs Gallardo, please. Sorry. My my mouth is failing me. No problem. And ask you to clarify and perhaps just give you a chance to clarify something. Councilman Sandoval asked you a few questions about your conclusions and public works about the site. So as I understood it, you do not need or have plans for this site, for transportation infrastructure right now, is that correct? That\\'s correct. And secondly, you\\'ve identified other locations where you could put transportation infrastructure. Yes. But for the bicycles specifically, we talked about the bicycles specifically was in the agreement that we know about between the developer and them. But we also have identified other areas in the in the in the area that we could have put a bicycle if necessary. Okay. Where I think things got muddy is though she asked you whether it could be used in the future. And I want to be really clear. Did you conduct any analysis that indicated it would be infeasible, i.e., not physically possible to utilize this for other types of transportation in the future? Because. Sorry, no. Yeah. As I stated before, there is obviously different things that can happen with more development in those type of things that that we are just based off of our assessment that we use for every vacation we use throughout the city. Didn\\'t see a use for this in that process. So what I\\'m asking you and I\\'m I\\'m going to be asking really specifically, did you conduct any analysis that term and it was infeasible, impossible or otherwise, not ever possible for this site to be used for transportation in particular. I know you don\\'t have plans. Yeah, I know you don\\'t want it, but I\\'m asking you if you made a technical determination. Right. So you\\'re asking me, is there is there just to clarify, is there no possibility whatsoever that we would use this for. I\\'m not talking about possibilities. I\\'m talking about technical feasibility. Did you analyze this and say definitively, no, it could not ever be used for transportation infrastructure? I\\'m asking a technical question because that\\'s the role you guys provide in this system. Right. And so that\\'s why I\\'m trying to pin you down more specifically, because I feel like what you want it for is not the question that I don\\'t think Councilwoman Sandoval was asking. And it\\'s not the question I\\'m asking. I don\\'t want to give you a false answer here. So I don\\'t know the entire of the process goes through. I believe it\\'s. 31 days of us going through and analyzing this with over 30 agencies internally and externally. We\\'re from the city to see if this is the proper direction to go or not. But I don\\'t I don\\'t think I can give you a definitive answer without asking, you know, Matt Brown or something else to be able to tell you definitively that that process was 100% to your your question. Let me ask can I try asking the question one other way, and then I accept is the answer is this you\\'re not sure? I totally get that. That\\'s what I\\'m saying. So to the extent others have identified potential future uses that this land may have for mobility purposes, have you done any analysis that specifically disqualifies or refutes those things that folks have identified as potential future uses of this. From the protests that we received? You mean. Any. Yeah, the protest or testimony in this or testimony in this chamber. There have been numerous emails. So so I\\'m not sure, you know, but if you if there are, generally speaking, been some ideas thrown out of things, this right of way could mean needed for in the future. Did you do any analysis that says those things are definitively not true? Yes, we had 42 protests that were received through the process that we have, and all 42 were deemed lack of technical merit on on our standard based off the analysis we made at Denver Public Works. Okay, we\\'re tot work we\\'re not connecting here in the question. Okay. Thank you very much for trying. Thank you, counsel. All right, round two. You know, I ask that you be as quick and concise as possible. Councilman Heights. Thank you, Mr. President. This is a my my questions now are about the R.A. that was or excuse me, 19 Chestnut Place was just created last Thursday. So. I guess. Mr. President, may I have you come up? Yes, it appears in our audience we have to pass to people who are residents in the immediate area who are in favor. We have seven, six people who are in present who are against who live in the immediate area. What\\'s to keep you from forming an R.A. that appears that would then appear to represent the majority of the people in this audience? That that is that is the question. I agree with you wholeheartedly. We counted Councilwoman CdeBaca. Totaled up the objections that she\\'s received in the last since we started the delay the deferrals of the and the question for the initial voting that we had that was done by people sending emails back and saying I\\'m for it or against it was about 80% for objections. Now there\\'s I think 63 have come in emails of commend recently, and 80% of those emails are objecting. I can tell. You. Right. Okay. Thank you. And I thank you for your time. I have a question for perhaps one of the attorneys, city attorneys in the room. This legal entity was created on Thursday for an R.A. that didn\\'t have standing, but now does. What\\'s to keep this legal entity from no longer being a going concern in a year when it\\'s time to renew the secretary of state? Like, I\\'m I\\'m trying to understand the enforceability of this agreement that I still haven\\'t had time to read because we just got it less than an hour before this meeting. But like. Like Kirkuk North, which was the other example, has been a going concern for a long time and is in perfect ten. Thank you Cherry Creek North people watching. But I guess I\\'m trying to understand like, ah, is this a lot iron clad, you know, can I put this in an ironclad lockbox next to Social Security and Medicare and, you know, those sorts of things? Or do you know what? Do you get the nature of the question? Yeah, I\\'ll take a stab at it. Troy Bratton from the city attorney\\'s office. Councilman Hines, I mean, I guess I don\\'t know how to answer the question there. They are incorporated, nonprofit. That is a legal entity. Things are going concerns until they\\'re not. I mean, I can\\'t say how long they will be, but I can say that they are now. And I haven\\'t reviewed the entire agreement. But it sounds to me like they are a registered nonprofit and they are incorporated as of right now, so. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. One last question for Mr. Gallardo. Welcome back. So public works won\\'t improve the property because it may be vacated at some point in the future. And that totally I mean, this is these are taxpayer dollars. So I totally understand that. Can the neighborhood improve the property? No. I mean, there\\'s there\\'s always options to be able to do these type of things. I don\\'t know that there\\'s a direct pathway for us to say that a neighborhood can give the city money in there because it\\'s an investment that they would be making on something that could also be vacated in this situation. So I don\\'t know that the city would get involved in an agreement that would allow somebody to invest into it, putting a park, green infrastructure or those type of things on this land, and then still be guided by state law that says it would be vacated if it doesn\\'t have a mobility or utility use. I just don\\'t know that there\\'s a process for that. So. Okay. Would public works. Issue. Assistant Dismissed order. If, say, the immediate neighbors just decided, hey, we\\'re just going to spend money and we totally understand that it might it might be wasted. But, you know, maybe they want to put on or patch grass or I don\\'t know. That might be a better question to be asked to the city attorney\\'s office. But. Okay. And this is my last question, Mr. President, would your city attorney please answer that? Thank you. Martin play municipal operations city attorney\\'s office. Citizens can apply for an encroachment permit to place things in the right of way. I would say it\\'s possible that someone could apply for an encroachment permit to put. Something in the right of way, like in private with grass or I don\\'t know. I think it actually has a sidewalk and maybe some trees there now, but I\\'m not 100% sure on that. But yeah, I think there is a process involved, but that goes through public works in terms of the approval process. And if it\\'s a Tier three encroachment, then it actually comes to the city council. So there isn\\'t anything explicitly in your knowledge or legal opinion that would keep the city from telling them, No, you can\\'t build something on. If they applied for an encroachment. Permit or whatever. I think that\\'s a fact specific question. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Catherine. Councilman Black. I apologize for asking more questions, but I\\'m going to try and be quick. Mark Pollock I just found your email. Someone was asking you a question or Councilman Hines is asking questions about the status of your R.A. So how long has R.A. been around? I believe it was 2016. Okay. So you\\'ve been around for a while? A little while. You didn\\'t file with the secretary of state? Correct. A legitimate R.A. for several years. Correct. And how many people live within the R.A.? I believe it\\'s about 3500 people. 500? It\\'s a large number. We\\'re pretty we\\'re pretty pretty significant. Okay. So it\\'s a very, very, very tiny minority of people who are here tonight. So I just. It\\'s like less than half a percent of the people who are here tonight. So I just it\\'s important for us to remember that everyone who is here is not sort of representing the entire neighborhood. And then can I. George, I\\'m sorry. I don\\'t know how to pronounce your name. That\\'s it\\'s a cool last name for patients. So I\\'m really curious what you object, what you are. Are you objecting to the hotel? And what would you like there? And are you not okay with what they\\'re proposing? The 4500 square feet of open space with benches and all that. Okay, we are objecting. We actually we\\'re all fine. And building the hotel, that\\'s that\\'s fine. And we understand they\\'re going to be developing what we\\'re objecting to. What I\\'ve learned is that most of the people in the neighborhood are objecting to is giving up the open space. The that right of way is on the corner and it\\'s at the entrance to the neighborhood. So that that will be even though there\\'s some of that that\\'s coming back, there\\'s there\\'s a you know, there\\'s six or seven stories of the hotels going to be put over top of it. So the people are objecting to giving up that one third of their property, that that is the right of way. That is the objection. Nothing to do with the hotel. The hotel I think they\\'ll build if they\\'re going to build a good hotel and a big lot of other good hotels in the small lot. So even though if it\\'s not vacated, the city\\'s not going to make it something, a plaza or anything like that. Well, now there is there\\'s you know, what you\\'re talking about is encroachments. That\\'s what was done at this over by on Platte Street. That was an encroachment. And, you know, that\\'s something we didn\\'t know about. But there\\'s certainly been a lot of discussion among the houses and businesses in the area about doing an encroachment, probably not a million and a half dollars and encroachment, but you can put flour boxes and, you know, we can make that continue to make it look better, which is what the Griffis did. It used to be sky. When they when they built that, they put the concrete in the trees that are in there now. They installed that there. That was an encroachment. They paid $200 a year for it. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Councilman Ortega. Okay. Two very last questions. The first one, Mr. Johnson, if you could come back up, did you in the neighborhood talk about putting a covenant on the property to insure specifically on this right away property, to ensure that all of the things that are committed to in the agreement are even more solidified? So I would say that the agreement is in the nature of the covenant is in the nature of a covenant. And specifically, it has the language that you talked about earlier in terms of passing it on to those who who own the property in the future. We did not talk about binding it with the covenant specifically because my client doesn\\'t own the property. Okay. And they couldn\\'t do that at this point. Okay. And I\\'m not sure you\\'re the right one to answer this next question, but what what about this right way property? What is it about this property that makes the hotel work at this location? I think this might be a question for Mr. Sweet. Okay. Mr. Sweet. Thank you. Taber Sweep with Mortenson Development. Councilwoman The I think if you remember the last time we. Had put out some images, I think to you guys in a package. So this particular. Right of way. Is important because we are going to be, as George described it, going. Over, but we\\'re going to be cantilevered a piece of the. Building over the right of way. So what\\'s really crucial for us. Is where those columns. Come down on to what is. Now the right of way, which. Will then become privately owned. We can\\'t cantilever. A building above. You can\\'t do that. With a type two encroachment or anything like that. It has to be owned. And so that allows us to create the hotel that we\\'ve designed and submitted for, for planning approval or for SDP. So what, what portion of the building then? Occupies this space because I\\'ve been hearing that part of the expectation is that it would continue to remain open space. Yeah, there\\'s only a very small sliver of building that actually. Occupies part of the right of way on the very eastern sorry western edge. The remainder of it is actually open to automobile traffic. And then a piece of the. Plaza which we\\'ve dictated into that development agreement. There\\'s an exhibit as well that we\\'re going to create. We\\'re going to incorporate that in our in our easement back to public works. So the plaza area. Although it\\'s underneath the. Overhang, will still be a public space. So some of the discussions about bicycle or scooter parking or whatever it needs to be, that will still be public use in perpetuity. We\\'re not trying to stop anybody from using that. They can use it as they do today, along with the existing right of way on the corner. So you\\'re saying there would continue to be an easement on the property? That is, is it deeded back to the city? Help me understand, Jim. I\\'d have to give you the correct. Terminology, but. We are providing an easement back to public works for the storm line that. Is there. And we will expand, correct? Jim, correct me if I\\'m wrong, they\\'ll expand the rights of that easement to include that plaza area to the west of that storm line. All but four where those columns come down. Got it. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. I have no further questions. Thank you, Councilwoman. All right. At long last, the continued public hearing for Constable 776 is officially closed. Comments by members of council, Kallstrom said. Welcome. Thank you, Mr. President. This land vacation is on it. On its face should not be granted. There\\'s indeed technical merit as it\\'s currently being used for transportation use. Just because transportation is evolving from car supremacy to multi-modal forms of transfer tation does not mean that we should isolate our own understanding of transportation use to be the equivalent of car use. Additionally, this land vacation has been wildly opposed by the surrounding neighbors and others. Originally, public works pulled all 21 adjacent property owners and 71% objected in total since the first time we heard this request. Our office has has received 63 on duplicated opinions and 49 were against or opposed, which is 78%. We\\'ve had only 14 support and only four who have since changed their minds since the last time we heard this. The last the land vacation will increase. Chestnuts, places land by 50%. Yes, the city gains land through dedications and trades off through through land, vacations all the time. But it\\'s not appropriate in this case, as this developer is not asking for a corner or an alley to be vacated. It is manipulative to suggest that this is for a common good when this is very clearly a developer windfall. They are increasing buildable square footage from 12144 to 18094 square feet in one of the most expensive commercial and residential neighborhoods in our city and Union Station. We all know what it looks like. What they\\'re describing looks like when you go to a hotel and pull in under under a structure. It\\'s not. It\\'s not public or open space. There\\'s approximately 6000 square feet of free land for a one time fee of 1600 dollars. This developer has manipulated the process to isolate and alienate its neighbors and has still failed to convince a substantial number of residents to change their mind about their opposition. Three people made a decision for an entire neighborhood and are speaking as the sole authority being recognized as the community. We we say we care about ADA access. We say we care about multimodal transportation. We say we care about climate action and reducing congestion. Congestion. What we have an opportunity in front of us to prove it. Neighbors want to see us dedicate modern transportation docking stations to areas that do not inhibit ADA access. Areas exactly like this can serve this purpose. Yes. Public works cannot lean on developers to to provide transportation support. Yes. Current public transportation, including scooters, is being provided by private corporations. Yes. Private corporations owning bike and scooter share programs are currently monopolizing any and all other public right of way without being required to designate docking stations in areas that make sense. None of that excuses public works from its poor stewardship. Again, this is currently being used for public transportation, regardless of who has taken on that responsibility in absence of our leadership. I had from my colleagues I heard from my colleagues in the previous hearings that we recognize the ability to exponentials and extract profit from any land left in the city. Preservation happens in a multitude of ways, and preserving public ownership of the right of way for the evolution of transportation is in itself preserving the opportunity for transportation in an overdeveloped area of town. The bottom line is that if we can walk on it, bike on it, scoot on it, then it meets the criteria to remain in the hands of the public and not a private developer who will extract value from it at our expense. Please vote in a way that shows our residents of Denver that we truly and meaningfully want to reverse the patterns of car dependency and supremacy while also being a good steward of public land and the planet generally. Nobody is telling the developer what to do with their land at this point. We are simply saying that they cannot also do what they want with public right of way without regard for all of the people who live in this community and have very clearly made their voices known. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Cannick. Thank you, Mr. President. I have been very quiet during most of this debate, just asked a couple of questions and have relied mostly on the testimony in the hearings and probably wasn\\'t going to speak. But I have a couple concerns I need to. On the record with my vote. So first, how am I going to vote? I think this is a very dense area and I think in this area and others like it, we\\'re having a lot of conflicts between transportation users and a lot of risks that those transportation users experience because of those conflicts. I did not I know that my question perhaps I should have shared it with the department had a time, but I didn\\'t think of it beforehand. But in spite of their decision that there was no technical merit, it\\'s my experience that usually technical merit is things like if I grant this right of way vacation, then I won\\'t be able to get out of my garage or my property will be impeded. What I don\\'t believe that that technical merit analysis includes is a feasibility for future transportation, and that is for me. I am concluding that it is feasible for future transportation purposes, and that\\'s important. So what am I weighing that against and weighing that against the community need for additional hotel rooms, basically. I will share that. We had a very similar debate a few months ago where there was an R.A. that negotiated a good neighbor agreement and then there was other neighbors that did not support that agreement. And they were, in that case, going to build some very modest increased density that\\'s in line with the plans we\\'ve adopted. And in my mind, the housing need of our city outweighed it. So for me, it\\'s not about, you know, I\\'m not choosing one side or another. I\\'m trying to weigh these things. And in this case, I don\\'t think the the needs of additional hotel rooms weigh more heavily than the potential future use of this site for transportation. So I\\'ll be voting against the vacation tonight based on that weighting. But why am I weighing in? I do want to say that I think it\\'s really important. There\\'s been a lot of concerns hurled at the Register neighborhood organization. And I just want to share for the record that I think it\\'s very difficult to generate engagement with registered neighborhood organizations before a controversy exists. You flier, you invite people, you email, people say they\\'re going to come. It\\'s very difficult to get people engaged. And so then an organization does the best it can in a situation where they are not in control of the result. They are not in control of whether this vacation happens or not. And so they decide to either put all their eggs in the basket of trying to kill it or to try to negotiate something to make it better should it pass. So I want to ask that maybe as this neighborhood heals after this experience, we think a little bit about the value of trying to negotiate for something rather than let it being, you know, an ugly overhang with concrete underneath. So whether you agree or disagree with the vacation, I see some very good intentions that the I.R.A. had. And having worked with R.A. for almost a decade or more, if you count my time before a council, I think they\\'re not in an easy position, given how difficult it is to get people to engage until a moment like this. So I think they made a good effort, and I hope that there can be some healing that recognizes that. The other concern I have is just that there was a lot of it\\'s clear my colleagues had a lot of concern. And in the heart of that concern, there started to be a lot of potentially messages or questions that really potentially undermined the potential strength of neighborhoods, the value of good neighbor agreements, the enforceability. And I guess I just want to say I\\'m a little nervous. What is the incentive to the extent that neighborhoods have used these tools, frankly, very effectively? I don\\'t have a long list of failed and unenforced good neighbor agreements. Frankly, in my time in office. I think that they generally work well, they\\'re generally followed. There\\'s been very few examples I\\'ve heard of of them not being enforced. So when we spend a lot of energy talking about how unenforceable and unreliable they are, what we are doing is we are reducing the incentive of neighbors to engage in dialog and we are reducing the incentive of developers to commit to some changes and adjustments . And that worries me. I don\\'t want neighbors to have less ability to negotiate directly for things that are important to them. The test for our land use decisions can never be unanimous support, right? Some folks want to have a clear a majority, a majority of those responding. We\\'re never going to probably know the majority of folks who live in an area because we can\\'t survey them all. But I just want to say that I am voting against this vacation tonight. But I still think these are important tools and I hope that we don\\'t find our way to undermining them to the point that they are no longer a tool that can be effective. And I\\'m a little nervous about the outcome of my vote because of that. But I think that if we keep talking about it, perhaps we can find a path where we can support these tools while still having the vote of conscience that we need, rather than thinking we have to attack the tool to justify our no votes. So with that, I\\'ll be voting no, but with a lot of respect for those who tried hard in this case. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Herndon. Mr. President, I share Councilwoman Kennedy\\'s concerns. I just come to a different conclusion. I\\'ll first say that I will support the vacation, and here are some reasons why. One, I trust the work that the analysis that Public Works has done. As it was stated earlier, there were numerous objections to this vacation. And as Jason said, he went through the, I think, tireless process to make sure that each of those objections didn\\'t did not have merit. So I trust that you did your due diligence in ensuring that you were making the right decision, saying that we don\\'t have a use for this land. I do think, though, if we follow the notion that if you could there ever be a time that we could possibly use this land, then sure, and we shouldn\\'t vacate anything. And there might be some people on council who support that notion. That\\'s just not something that I do, because for us to hold onto the land when we didn\\'t pay for it and as we\\'ve had conversations about this before, that doesn\\'t seem fitting to me. So that that is so I believe and that\\'s usually where the vacation stop with the analysis. But we have gone above and beyond when it comes to this. Councilman Black made the comment, why are we here? And I feel responsible because I was the one that requested the delays. And so as the chair of Ludie, when I when this first came to committee, there was a concern from the developer, like, hey, we know there\\'s we know the community has some concerns and we would like to sit down and have that conversation with with the community, which I felt was noble. Let\\'s let\\'s sit down and see if we can we can hash out our differences, which is why there was the first request for a delay, because you want the parties to come together. So we as a council don\\'t have to be that body that chooses winners and losers. As I bring back Councilwoman Jeannie fights. And so when we were here three weeks ago, we recognized that the Arno was not registered with the state, which causes a problem and doesn\\'t allow you to sign a contract agreement if you reach one, which brought us to the second delay to where we are now. So for me, the question was if we can reach a place where the R.A. and the developer can come to an agreement, I believe we\\'re in a good place and that\\'s where we are today. And so that\\'s another reason why I support this. I absolutely want to commend you all for being a part of an R.A., a volunteer board, because as a person who was on Stapleton, United Neighbors, the Sun board, I know the pain that you go through where people say you\\'re hiding and you don\\'t know and you readily publish it and you encourage your neighbors to come for whatever reason they do or don\\'t. And so thank you for volunteering to be a part of that. And I would also say to the people in Union Station North, if you\\'re not in support, join the Arno George. I\\'m sorry, I\\'m I didn\\'t want to ask the questions because we\\'ve been here long enough. But why you chose to step off? Because then you lose your opportunity to be the voice as a member of the Arno Board. And so for the other people that are here and say, I object joined the board, that\\'s what that\\'s how you can make sure that your your voice is being hard. Because when we look we can\\'t look to a community of 3500 our different neighborhoods. We look to the people who say, I\\'m going to step up and I want to be as a voice of the board. So thank you all for doing that. And as Councilwoman Kennedy talked about, the the hard the difficulty of doing this concerns me as well, because we have an Arno board that I said, yes, we have an agreement in place and this council might very well say no still. And that could send a message to future Arnaud\\'s. Why would we go through this process if we agree? The two parties agree and council still says no. We have that prerogative and that\\'s why we\\'re here. We make the difficult decisions. I think in this case, this wouldn\\'t be a time to make that decision. You and as I trust, the binding, the validity of the agreement. So I don\\'t see any reason to think that that cannot be enforceable. And so from the parties involved have always been willing to come together. So this is why I will be supporting the vacation. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Hines. Thank you. Sorry. Thank you, Mr. President. So I\\'m still new here. I can\\'t use that for much longer, but. But certainly, as we continue to grow as a new body, we learn things. We look, we gain wisdom. I\\'d like to think I\\'m an intelligent person, but. But I don\\'t have a lot of wisdom through which I can make this decision. So I want to thank my colleagues for their patience as I asked a lot of questions which may have seemed silly, but it helped me understand more about this issue, but also more about the Arno process, about vacations. And I feel like I need a vacation after all this talk about vacations, but I\\'m still like I when we were here three weeks ago, I said, I\\'m confused. I just I can\\'t reconcile, you know, some of the some of the things that we\\'re talking about. And I still am unable to reconcile some of the some of the concerns about, you know, the vote of the board, which is three members, versus what seems to be the concern of the neighbors. And and so I talked a lot about over the last year plus about values. I think it\\'s important for us to have elected officials that have a value system through which we use those values to guide, guide our decisions. So I talked about housing, transportation and representation again and again and again over the last year. And so let\\'s talk about housing. I think, you know, it\\'s already it\\'s already been discussed. This is hotel space, not housing. And so it really isn\\'t part of that. You know, the value that I used that I said again and again and again was important to me. And I\\'m here because of the things I said. Hopefully I told the truth. I meant to tell the truth, but that\\'s what I said a lot of times. And I don\\'t see how this fits into the value of housing, this transportation. I firmly believe that we should encourage more non car transit. The the artist rendition that I saw was a driveway. I don\\'t want more cars going through what is already a very dense neighborhood and and an already an extremely walkable area of town, probably the most walkable in the state. So that\\'s that\\'s a little frustrating to me as well. When we\\'re giving we\\'re theoretically potentially giving up non car transit access representation. So if I\\'m going to vote against this, which by the way I\\'m leaning towards no and that that will ultimately be my vote, why don\\'t I vote in favor of yet another delay from three weeks ago to today? Well, because I believe we all deserve to be heard. We all deserve to have our conversation be heard as long as we can. And here we are. And I wanted to give people the benefit of the doubt and give people time. I think it was a little frustrating three weeks ago that we got a bunch of information about an hour before our council meeting, and I had to try to digest that at the last minute. And I\\'m frustrated again tonight that we got a whole bunch of information less than an hour before. I can\\'t I can\\'t read a legal document in 40 minutes and do some other things that I\\'m trying to do last minute to prepare for this meeting. So just so I recognize also, I think that, you know, something that I said over and over again, that I one of the highest compliments I had was someone repeated this back and didn\\'t know that I said it. So I thought that was really cool. Development should happen for the city, not to the city. And I\\'m I don\\'t I don\\'t see how this really is making the neighborhood a better place. I don\\'t see how this is this is doing something that will make the neighbors a, you know, a more whole community. And and so I also recognize that we\\'ve had, you know, some concerns about Arnaud\\'s. Does this undermine the Arno process? I think that\\'s a reasonable concern. I think another reasonable concern that people have had is, is that some feel that the R.A. system, as it is now already doesn\\'t represent the neighborhood. I think that some RINO\\'s are better than others. I\\'m not saying that just we have you know, we have a lot of Arnaud\\'s and and so I\\'m not you can\\'t judge them all the same. I think they have their own personality because they\\'re comprised of their own sets of people and some are more indicative than others. I would say I recognize that there\\'s a concern and I recognize Councilman Kenney, just thoughts about the R.A. process. And I want to say that we\\'re already considering, you know, revisiting the R.A. process. And I think that this is a this could be used as a case to make sure that we we use this in our consideration to make sure that we empower our nose to be a full, fully representative of the people that they\\'re supposed to represent. So I\\'ll be voting no. Thank you so much for everyone who\\'s here and for my colleagues for allowing us to have this extended conversation. I certainly intend for other conversations to be quicker because we spent more time vetting out some of the ideas tonight. So thank you. Thank you, gentlemen. Haynes. Councilman Torres. Thank you, Mr. President. So in this process, I think a number of things have been highlighted for me, and I\\'m growing appreciative of. The complicated. Subjects we\\'ve been taking on as a council in the past three months. But nearly all of the emails of opposition that were forwarded to me focused on an argument of open space. I don\\'t fully accept this argument as a singular cause for denial. Residents in the area, especially from this particular spot, are within a ten minute walk to a multi acre park of commons coronavac a variety along the South Platte River. That said, I initially kind of entered into this discussion thinking vacation requests were pretty cut and dry and that it was largely a process dictated by state requirements. But even the language that we put on our public site emphasizes that there\\'s a number of factors that weigh in to approval, and those include impact and effect . And specifically, we say there\\'s no guarantee the request will be approved. A thorough understanding of the need to vacate. Combined with the support of all adjacent landowners and members of the public who may be affected by such an action is important before beginning this process. That that piece, I think, is, is one. Of the things that\\'s. Moving me on this because of how complicated this has become. My difficulty. With this is whether or not. A neighborhood supports the proposed project. And we have put the R.A., the the Union Station, North Reno, in the spotlight to fast track becoming a nonprofit, to becoming an entity with the singular purpose of entering into this agreement, which we asked you to do. And I feel like that\\'s been problematic of our process. Additionally, find it problematic that this isn\\'t the only R.A. that covers this particular property. The ballpark collective also geographically covers this property. Whether or not they\\'re active, I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know how long they\\'ve been involved. But this is not singular to Union Station North to this particular R.A. and the fact that this is actually the Five Points neighborhood. So when we\\'re talking about the neighborhood supports, the neighborhood does that hasn\\'t been mentioned at all in in the language, in the process and or by the folks that have reached out to me. I feel like that. Has been forgotten in a lot of ways. I think we there has been. This is a muddied process. And because this is a particular area of emphasis, even in our own language, to the public on what\\'s involved in a vacation request. I don\\'t think we\\'ve done justice to a public approval process for this to move forward. So I\\'ll be I believe I\\'ll be. Opposing this request. Thank you, Councilwoman. Towards Councilman Black. Thank you, Mr. President. This is a really tough one. I see both sides in my almost four and a half years on council. We have never voted against a vacation or a dedication, so or even had anyone express an opinion. Well, that\\'s not true. What former Councilman Espinosa did all the time. But the rest of us didn\\'t. But so this is new to me and. And I\\'m I\\'m a bit tormented about it because we have approved so many. And I like to follow the law and I like to be consistent in my votes. And it\\'s very hard for all of us to sit up here and have people who are so passionate that they sit on those horrible seats and listen to all of us talk way too much until 9:00 at night on a freezing cold night. And so we are swayed by all of you and we really appreciate your passion. But in the end, I always feel like I need to go back to that legal advice that I have gotten a lot of times from our attorney about this and about one that\\'s in my district. And then to respect the the analysis that public works did. I am going to I am going to vote for it. I don\\'t think it\\'s going to pass. I appreciate your work in the development agreement. I think it looks cool. I mean, my district doesn\\'t have anything like that. That\\'s that cool. But also, George, what you said was another option. You know, also might be a good way to go. But just to be true to who I am, I, I like to stick with the advice I get and be consistent in my votes. I am going to vote no. Thank you, councilman. Black councilman said I\\'m sorry. I\\'m voting yes. See how tormented I am? Thank you, Councilman Black. Councilwoman Sandoval. Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. So in northwest Denver, vacations are a hot topic because we have what\\'s called carriage lots, and a lot of them are owned by the city and county of Denver. And so you had a city square block, and in the middle, in the back, you had a square that were actually used for carriages and horses. And so Northwest Denver has been the hotbed of I\\'ll Ride Away vacations. And actually one time I was a council aide to Councilman Espinoza. This body did vote down an alley vacation because of all the work that we had done in the office. And to Councilwoman CNOOC\\'s point about undermining the process of a good neighbor agreement. In my opinion and in my personal time as a council aide since 2012, and I used to work for the councilmember who represented Ball Park Neighborhood, I would say 80% of the time good neighbor agreements work out. The only time that they have never worked out for me is in a right of way vacation. And it\\'s so sad to see. I hated it. I hated having to go through a whole mediation process and having the neighbors get together and have a mediator go through the process. And the developers say they were going to do something and then the city council voted to allow it and then it didn\\'t fall through. And all of the agreements and all of the time that the neighborhood had put into that work wasn\\'t followed through on. And for me, that was very personal because it was on the block that I grew up on, under the carriage lot that I played on as a little girl. And I was just working for Judy and I didn\\'t even understand this process. I was very new to it. So I just want to say thank you all for your work, even if this is democracy at its finest, right? If being able to disagree and being able to have a vote. But also I hope my hope is that you as neighbors can, once this is done, that you all go back to being neighborly because that\\'s what makes Denver great, is that if you all can use this, I believe that on the other side of conflict that you can actually grow if that\\'s what you choose to do. And I think that\\'s what we have to do up here as people who vote is that I have to take my other colleagues votes and I have to think about them and understand why they voted that way and not hold it against them and wash ourselves clean of this tonight and learn from the process. And through this process, I will just say that I during the research and meeting with the neighbors, this that this city of Seattle actually had to come up. It was brought to my attention that the city of Seattle actually came up with a right of way policy that was adopted in May of 2018, because they were having these same issues that we were in Denver. They didn\\'t know how to vote on them. There was no legal authority over them, there was no criteria on them. And it kept going back and forth. It was this real gray area. So I\\'m just going to say that I\\'m one to as a council and as a council person, I want to bring these policies into Denver so that the next time they come forward, we actually have a criteria to talk about this situation because we, as Councilman Cashman mentioned, when we do rezonings, we have five criteria. We know what they are. We\\'re very well versed on them, and here we\\'re all floundering. And so I would like to give us more tools in the toolbox. So thank you for bringing this to my attention during this work. And ultimately, I will just be a no vote and I\\'m not a no vote just because the R.A. was incorporated last Thursday. I\\'m not a no vote just because it doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s rep reflective representation, even though I know it\\'s really hard to get an R.A. going, I just don\\'t believe that there is clear guidance, like the guidance that on the Public Works website with on the landing page, when you go to an alley vacation or right away vacation, bullet point three and four. Talk about your adjacent neighbors and their objections. And for me, I have to be have reflective representation. And if this was in my district. And there were people who sat in these chairs. When it says on public works, landing page bullet three and four that your voice matters. Your voice matters to me tonight. So thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Sandoval. Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. I really appreciated having this delay, because when we were last here, I was very much up in the air trying to weigh things. But for me, it I\\'ve never had a call in four years of someone begging me for a hotel room. Just seriously, it\\'s just not the case. But I get calls almost every day or every discussion I have, whether it\\'s at a neighborhood meeting or at breakfast with friends, about the need for for affordable housing. And that\\'s at all levels. That\\'s not just 0 to 30. That\\'s that\\'s up to 120% of area median income. It\\'s difficult to live in Denver. We all know this. You know, I think many of us, if not all of us on the dais, have gotten involved in discussions with developers on different projects and where they\\'ll say, well, you know, we really you need to give us the zoning that we want or we\\'re just going to have to build crap, or we\\'ll will build we\\'ll just take the existing zoning and just max that out. And what what I would say in this case is give me a project that truly addresses our city\\'s critical need. I\\'ll talk to you about the vacation. I mean, I have concern physically about, you know, I drove this area several times the way the proposed extra 63 rooms, I think that would stick out into the right of way would close in that intersection. I have concern about that. But if this were really a high community value, I\\'d be willing to talk about that. Not saying that it\\'d be a guaranteed. Yes, but I\\'d be willing to talk about it. So. That\\'s that\\'s what I\\'ll be basing my no vote on. And I\\'m smiling because I just have to add this. If you talk to my kids, they\\'ll tell you the one sin is. Don\\'t bring me last minute stuff. Don\\'t. And I don\\'t I would just be serious about that for a second. You know, we\\'ve had a month at least to deal with this. And I think to bring this council a document that could have been so important at the last minute, I think is playing a little fast and loose. And so. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilwoman Sawyer. Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to say that I think that, you know, Councilman, can you just point and Councilman Hines point earlier is so very important for those of you who are here tonight, who live in this neighborhood, get involved in your I.R.A.. I mean, I ran for city council because I felt like my R.A. was not representing me in my community. I literally am sitting here today because of a development that I did not want to see in my community that drove me to run for city council. Get involved in your R.A. That is your option. Participate in the process. This is this is how this works. And and, you know, it seems likely, based on the response of most of my council members, that this vacation is going to fail tonight. And I just want you to know that that is not a reflection of you. It\\'s not a reflection of the work that you are doing as the leader of your R.A.. We have had a lot of discussion as council members about how we can better support you as R.A. leaders, because we need to do a better job of that as a city. It\\'s something I want you to know that we are looking into. Councilman Cashman and I have talked a lot about it. I think, you know, it\\'s something that\\'s very it\\'s very difficult job to be an R.A. leader. There are a lot of Arnaud\\'s in the city, and there are a lot of rules. There are a lot of in order to to faithfully represent your community is a very difficult thing. And, you know, to to fairly take a vote is a very difficult thing. Everyone will always question everything you do right. And so there have got to be better ways for us to make sure that community members who can\\'t get to a meeting because they have kids or because they\\'ve got to work or whatever, you know, that we can include their voices and there\\'s got to be a way that we can better support our R.A. leaders and better support our community members to make sure that they can participate in the R.A. process better to make sure that this works better for everyone. Otherwise, our R.A. process simply isn\\'t working. It\\'s not reflective of our community as a whole. I know it because that\\'s why I am literally that\\'s why I\\'m sitting here today. So I just wanted to thank you for your work. I wanted to thank all of the community members who are here speaking out. All of you. I know this is so difficult. I know it\\'s a long night. And I truly just want to impress upon you how important it is to get involved in your community organization and be a part of the voice of the community. Because if you feel like you\\'re not being represented fairly, then you you\\'ve got the opportunity to change that. So please do. And with that, I also I\\'m going to be of a no vote tonight. So thank you very much. Thank you, Councilwoman, to our Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. I\\'ll try to be short. A lot of my comments have already been made. I drive this area quite routinely. I live in northwest Denver and drive through that area as a shortcut to get on to. To get over to the Globeville neighborhood or other areas of downtown. And it is congested as hell today. Right. And and as we as a city start moving more and more towards requiring areas to have transportation demand management, we have to have that infrastructure in place to deal with all the different components that make it work so that people are not having to own a car to move around the city. And we know that scooters and bikes have played a big role in part of that process. Right. So when we take away a location that has been serving that function, it it sort of negates the the the direction that we have been moving to as a city to try to address some of these issues. We\\'re dealing with this same challenge with the 41st and Fox station area, where we\\'re seeing a lot of new development coming in and we\\'re, you know, saying you have to have a team plan. We\\'re capping the parking. Actually, we\\'re we\\'re doing that through a different tool, but it\\'s the same effect will reduce how many parking spaces people can have in that area. But you need the infrastructure in place for the different components of this to work. And in this case, this was a site where you could do is pull up the maps and you see the the docking station for the bikes right on the on the maps. So, you know, I routinely patronize the King Soopers in the area. There\\'s a lot of pedestrian traffic that crosses 20th Street trying to get back and forth. Not only their Whole Foods is is just the next block over. And and so I\\'m concerned that we\\'re taking every little nook and cranny and trying to do everything, you know, vertical. And yes, we have been intentional in this city about looking at where we want vertical development. But does that mean every little corner has to be as dense as as possible? So my concerns are more about the logistics of the site as much as some of the other issues that have been expressed by by my colleagues. So I will also be voting no on this site tonight. I appreciate all the work that everybody has done on both sides, trying to find some middle ground on on, you know, being able to negotiate something that that can be workable. But. You know, unfortunately, it looks like the votes are not there for this to move forward tonight. So I\\'ll will be a no vote. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you all for sticking with us this late into a cold evening on hard benches, it is finally time to vote. Madam Secretary, roll call. See tobacco? No black. Flynn. No. Gilmore. No. Herndon. I had no Cashman. Kenny. Ortega. No. Sandoval. Sawyer. No. Torres. No. Mr. President. No. I\\'m secretary. Please close the voting.

According to the city charter, the city clerk has 20 days for receipt of notice from King County elections to file the notice with the city council. The city clerk filed her report and the certificate of sufficiency with the council before this clerk file on June 28th. This action started the 45 day clock for council action on the initiatives. In order to provide my colleagues with additional time to consider this initiative. I\\'m recommending holding this clerk file for another week.

As a reminder, the city\\'s election code C-11 is for code 2.04300. Prohibits elected officials and city employees from using their office for the promotion or opposition of any ballot measure. According to the code, we should refrain from discussing the merits of the initiative until we are actually voting on legislation to support or oppose the ballot proposition. That will occur at a future meeting and within 45 days of the clerk file of this clerk file being filed with the council. I recommend that Council members refrain from discussing this initiative today and until the Council considers legislation supported or opposing this ballot proposition.
